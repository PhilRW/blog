A collection of inconsequential ramblings by Phil, with the occasional Osophy thrown in for good measure.

Presently and permanently under construction.

I've been blogging for a long time. Long before popular web services like blogger and way before Apple introduced any of their software solutions. Yet in these years I've managed to say surprisingly very little. This website is maintained and hosted by yours truly and the whole blog is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and served statically. ~~kept on the server with a PHP frontend, and MySQL backend, and everything else in between that's necessary to keep it running smoothly. Smooth being a malleable condition.~~

This weblog started life as pMachine, moved to ExpressionEngine, moved again to WordPress, and finally moved to Hugo. I'm always trying to make things easier for me, which is typically a never ending struggle of time consuming difficult technical steps.
