Every network TV promo I’ve ever seen included the Eastern and
Central time zones. Like, “Tomorrow on NBC at 9, 8 Central.” The 9 of
course stands for the Eastern and Pacific time zones. The East Coast and
West Coast have separate network feeds, so when it’s 9 pm Eastern time,
the people on the West Coast will have to wait three hours to watch the
same show. That’s fine and dandy and I can live with that. I can even
live with the fact that people living in the Central time zone watch the
show off the East Coast feed, which is of course one hour earlier on
their clocks. What I don’t like is the way the networks handle the
Mountain time zone. Yes, there are people living in that great expanse
called “The West.” Sure, we may make up the least populated time zone,
but that doesn’t mean they can forget about us. And to make it better
sometimes we get the Eastern network feeds and some time we get the
Western network feeds, so when the announcer says, “Thursday at 9, 8
Central on NBC.” What he should really say is, “Thursday at 9, 8
Central, 7 or 10 Mountain depending on your local cable or satellite
provider.” And I’ll bet the satellite folks could get either.




By the way, you probably already knew this, but big awards shows like
the Oscars are done live—for the East Coast. So if they’re set to air
at 7 pm then they started at 4 pm local (Los Angeles). They’re taped and
then rebroadcast three hours later for their Pacific—home—audience. So
if you live in L.A. and have friends in NYC, turn off your phone and
don’t check your email if you want to experience the Oscars “live.” That
is, if you don’t have access to the East Coast feed.
