I rarely laugh out loud from pure joy, but I did watching this video, several times, in fact. Although the video is promotional and highly controlled, it reaffirms everything I've believed about the future of self-driving car technology, and I'm even more excited that we're in line to purchase one of these cars.

Tesla also says they will demonstrate a coast-to-coast autonomous drive some time next year. I assume this means automatic charging, too.

>Self-driving vehicles will play a crucial role in improving transportation safety and accelerating the worldâ€™s transition to a sustainable future. Full autonomy will enable a Tesla to be substantially safer than a human driver, lower the financial cost of transportation for those who own a car and provide low-cost on-demand mobility for those who do not.
