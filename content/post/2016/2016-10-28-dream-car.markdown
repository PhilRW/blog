I had a dream about the [Model 3](https://www.tesla.com/model3) this morning. Among its features were a [thrust vector control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust_vectoring) rocket motor on the back, like the [Batmobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batmobile) meets an [F-22 Raptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-22_Raptor). This made it capable of landing vertically like the Falcon rocket. Also the rear view mirror was a frustratingly low-resolution LCD monitor that identified the year and model of each passing car, although the white text was sadly pixelated and difficult to read. The car came in a two-door coupe variant, which saved some money, but I ultimately decided we would get the sedan because they didn't actually make the coupe version (dreamland logic).
