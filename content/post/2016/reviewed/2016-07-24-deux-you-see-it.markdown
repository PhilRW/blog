The [Tesla Master Plan, Part Deux](https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux) is out (and if anyone is a [hot shot](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107144/), it's Elon), and if you haven't read it, read it. Since they're nearing completion of [part one](https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me) and the [media attacks against Tesla](/2016/05/13/a-closed-letter-to-tesla-and-elon-musk/) have just begun to warm up, the time is ripe.

I can't say I'm surprised about the overall plan because it makes perfect sense to me. I had anticipated in a small way some of the consequences of a self-driving car, but I hadn't considered hiring out my Tesla to go drive people around, driverless, Uber-style. I fully expect my car to be able to go run errands and pick-up/drop-off family and friends. Want a [Tobin's pizza](http://www.tobinspizza.com/) and won't need the car for a few days? Send it on a 2,000-mile errand to Normal, IL. Just be sure to call ahead first. I believe that my future children will never have to learn how to drive, unless for sport or recreation.

Some things I'm sure Tesla has considered:


  * How will the autonomous vehicles identify themselves to their fare? Personally I'm a fan of LED message signs, but that may be too tacky. Glance in to have a look at the giant LCD control panel? Perhaps. Or simply inform the passengers of the model, color, and license plate?

  * Where is my car now? Open the Tesla App and see its location, heading, velocity, and even (or especially) the live video feed from its camera system.


I can see economic opportunities emerging from self-driving cars that can run errands for you. Drive-through grocery pick-up with online ordering? Okay. :)

Also, how about the removal of on-street parking, instead having simple drop-off and pick-up zones where the car then goes to park itself, possibly quite a distance away? Or it just goes home and comes back later to pick us up?

We'll need some robust, autonomous self-charging capabilities, though. That [snake charger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMM0lRfX6YI) looks neat but how reliable will it be in the long term?

Anyway, I'm enjoying anticipating these future ~~problems~~ opportunities, for before long, tomorrow will be here.
