I am apparently a *conservative speaker* according to this article, and yes, I do not have any problem with using *like* as a verb or adjective. I still become irked at the inappropriate use of pronouns, particularly using either or subject or object pronouns incorrectly (with the occasional exception of using the objective first person in place of the subjective, i.e., "It's me.").<!--more-->

I'm not particularly fond of the _quotative_, preferring instead to use "said" or "asked" or "shouted" or many other more descriptive and expressive words, but I especially *dis*like the *discourse marker* and *discourse particle* versions of *like*, since it feels to me the same as phrases so overused that they garner their own acronyms to the point of pointlessness. Examples: FWIW, FYI, FTFY, FBOW, and FML. Just don't use them.

It's an interesting technical evaluation. I realize language is fluid but one can become sensitized to the mundane loquacity of a populace.

P.S. I also don't like (correct usage, ~~BTW~~ by the way) the use of "welp" in place of "well." Urbanfictionary ~~Urbandictionary~~ [claims](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Welp) it originated from _Dumb and Dumber_, an apt metaphor if naïvely optimistic on the part of the purists.
