> That massive number, which far exceeded optimistic forecasts, upends traditional thinking about how to sell cars and is expected to spur the auto industry to shift more dramatically to market electric technology to consumers, analysts said.

Sigh. They still don't get it and they probably never will. It's not *just* that the Model 3 is electric. And it's not *just* that the car is fast and sleek and high-tech. And it's not *just* that the car gets better over time through over-the-air software updates. And it's not *just* that they have a vast network of superchargers. And it's not *just* Tesla's direct sales, no-dealership model. It's **all** of these things ***combined***. And *that* is why traditional auto makers will probably never catch up. Chevy may have the 200-ish mile range Bolt but they don't have the other stuff. Sorry, establishment. You've had a good run, but you're **over**.
