As mentioned in [The DSA](/2016/11/14/the-dsa/), the rest of the media are now starting to catch up with the idea that our next Presidente may be our last. I wish I were hyperbolizing, but my perception remains that American society as a whole is on the decline. We have devalued intelligence, education, and compassion for too long and now we are starting to see the results.

Hate and fear now rule supreme, fueled by our mind-numbing and complacency-inducing opiates (both literal and [figurative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_of_the_people)), race to the bottom, and general idea that the American People are stupid, ignorant, arrogant, selfish, and greedy. People will become what you expect of them and the bottom line ($$) expects this of its consumers.

All gaze upon the glory of what we have become.
