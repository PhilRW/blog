Gizmodo speculates the unbranded, unlocked GSM Treo 650 will not have EDGE. I sure as hell hope it does, thank you very much. AT&T wireless (former) customers have EDGE access and T-mobile I’m sure is going to go EDGE sometime soon. I think, if anything, the Cingular version will be subsidy-locked, and **that’s it**. _Please_, PalmOne, let that be it.
