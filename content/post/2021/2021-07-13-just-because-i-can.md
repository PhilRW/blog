Just because I can do something doesn't mean I want to.

<!--more-->

Just because I have the capability of performing a task doesn't mean I want to be the only one who does it over and over forever and ever.

Want to surprise and impress me? Learn to do it yourself instead of asking -- or worse, assuming. I would be *thrilled* to teach something that I know or some process I invented.

Take the initiative, don't give the imperative.
