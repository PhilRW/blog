title: Apple Slices Help Keep Brown Sugar
wordpress_id: 63

I found out a great way to keep your brown sugar from going bad and hardening up into a rock: seal in an apple slice. I imagine this would work with any moisture-retaining object such as a fresh slice of bread or a ceramic object of some kind that had been soaked in water (see: Brown Sugar Bears). But not only does the apple slice keep the brown sugar moist, it restores previously semifossilized brown sugar to its former pliable glory.

Seriously, we had some brown sugar here that must have been hard and dry for at last 6 months. Put in an apple slice and a week or so later we could use the stuff again. Not that I really get excited over brown sugar, mind you, but it was pretty neat anyway.

Okay. That is all Iâ€™m going to write on the topic.
