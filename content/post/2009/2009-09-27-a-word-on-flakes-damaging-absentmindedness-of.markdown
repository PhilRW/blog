Please, people: if you ask someone to do something for you, you know, like a really cool job that is paid with money, please be sure that you want him to do it. Asking someone if he wants a particular job (and he responds with an enthusiastic “yes”) only to take that job away from that person soon after is not cool. Not cool at all. In fact, it is decidedly uncool.
