Why can’t people just get along?  
Why can’t people simply let others live  
and laugh  
and love?  
Alone. In peace. In their own joy.

What purpose does hurting others serve when those you hurt are happy?  
What good can come from tearing a person apart on the inside?  
What good does pain  
and anguish  
and hatred  
bring to anyone or anything?  
Ever?

Ever?

Why I hurt so much now I cannot disclose.  
It is too personal.

But now I hurt  
When just moments before  
I lived  
And laughed  
And loved

And I still live  
And I will laugh again  
And I never stopped loving, even for a second.

And those who hurt us  
Unintentionally  
Mean their best

But should really just accept,  
Move on,  
And live in their own laughter and love  
In peace and harmony.

And realize what they say can hurt.  
A lot.
