I interviewed today at a [local] Theater/Film/Video department to teach advanced postproduction this summer and got the job. The pay was decent and the actual work seemed like fun, too. The Chair of the department essentially offered me the job this morning and we set up a meeting to go over paperwork on Thursday. I was excited and happy, not only to be making money but to be working and teaching in my field.

Then I get a call this afternoon and he says that after talking with the original instructor that I won’t be able to teach the class because the first guy will be teaching it after all.

:frowning_face:

I didn’t even get a chance to write a blog entry about how happy I was.
