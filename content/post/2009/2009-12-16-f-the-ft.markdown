I worked from 10:00 am until 7:00 pm today. I could not have worked more because these were three separate IT/tech incidents. All of them were in remote locations, on-site as it were, and all of them I drove my own personal vehicle to and fro. I worked a total of 4.25 hours, logged 96 miles, and raked in a whopping $106.25 before taxes. Plus my last appointment was supposed to go for two hours and it went for four, causing unneeded stress, complicating my personal life, and causing me to go back on my word, something I do **not** take lightly nor enjoy by any means.

And that is why I hate this on-call, on-site, low pay, no-benefits, contract, techno-BS work.
