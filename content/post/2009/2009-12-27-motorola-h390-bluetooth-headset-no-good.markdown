title: 'Motorola H390 Bluetooth Headset: No Good'

I got a Motorola H390 Bluetooth headset for Christmas. I returned it because when turned on, in my ear, idle, and connected to my phone, it make a very quiet intermittent high-pitched beeping sound. It was annoying in a quiet room. I donâ€™t know if it was only my unit that was defective or the design of the H90 itself, but I give it a 1 out of 5. My advice: if you have good hearing, try it for a while in a quiet environment before you toss the receipt or the packaging.
