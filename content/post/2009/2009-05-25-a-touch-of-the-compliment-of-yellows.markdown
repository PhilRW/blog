I'm feeling a little left out this weekend.

My girlfriend's best friend is in town from the east coast, which apparently means I don't get to see my girl at all this weekend except for the show. I hope they have fun together, but if the best friend ever moves into town (or heaven forbid _moves in_), we're gonna have some issues to discuss.
