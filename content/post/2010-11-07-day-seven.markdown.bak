Today I must journey out, back towards the center of this desolate land. The journey will be perilous but I must do it. Should I survive then surely the results from this brief but dangerous trip will help me to escape this Godforsaken land. Should I not survive then I wish whosoever finds this journal to know that I harbor no resentment nor malice towards who- or whatever caused my arrival in this dark place. But should another soul come across this accounting, then I pity him and wish him better luck than I have had in escaping, for it must mean that he has arrived here as unfortunately as I.
