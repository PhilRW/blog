[![](https://blog.rosenberg-watt.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/PassportPhotoCropped-150x150.jpg)](http://philrw.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/passportphotocropped.jpg)I just turned in my passport paperwork for my possible trip to Canada in October. It cost me $165 for the book + card + processing fee. At least I got to take and print my photo at home. Don't I look great? :)
