I got a pilot car job for tonight! That should pay about $150.

<!--more-->

As you may or may not know, I run my own business called Phil’s Pilot Car.
My first job for the summer just came in today and I’ll be taking a modular home over Loveland Pass tonight around 20:00. Of course, commercial liability insurance is costing me $215/month, so I hope to get a couple more jobs before the summer’s out and I return to L.A. for the school year.
