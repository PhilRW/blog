I'm painting the ceiling. White. Flat white. Wet it doesn't look much different from dry. Dry it doesn't look much different from the primer it's covering. I'm looking hard for imperfections, areas I missed. Never mind the gouge or the dried paint chip now permanently embedded, those I can't fix with another coat.

I'm trying so hard to see imperfections that I start painting over shadows. The paint is actually fine, but the shadows through the windows create what looks like an area I missed in the paint. So I paint over shadows.

Who will ever look so closely at your ceiling as you when you're painting it?

Maybe it's good enough.

Shoot, I missed a spot in the bedroom.

Dang it.
