Well, there’s a first time for everything. I was driving south on Wadsworth past 1st Ave just now in the #1 lane and a lady in a plateless blue Caravan just changed into my lane. Not ahead of me, not behind me, _right next to me!_ I couldn’t tell if she signaled or not (because she was right next to me, hence I couldn’t see her signals), all I know is that she crossed over the line (like so many folks do with narrow lanes) so I drifted left a little bit, but instead of correcting herself—and greatly to my surprise—she kept going! Needless to say, I did too. Right into the turn lane. I honked for a good three seconds. She kept going like she never saw me. The lady behind me saw the whole thing and later when she pulled alongside to make a right turn, she looked at me and shrugged. I shook my head.

It’s a good thing I was paying attention. I would have been royally pissed if the lady in the blue Caravan had hit my car. I should have requested an officer issue her a summons for reckless driving. Unfortunately she didn’t have a license plate on her car. Nor a neuron in her head that was paying attention to the task at hand. Driving.
