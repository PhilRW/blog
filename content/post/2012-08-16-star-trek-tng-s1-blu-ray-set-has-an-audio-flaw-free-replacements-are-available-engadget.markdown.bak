Hey, guess what? Remember [that thing that I wanted](http://www.amazon.com/Star-Trek-Generation-Season-Blu-ray/dp/B0083TUEHY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1345077981&sr=8-1&keywords=star+trek+next+gen+blu+ray) and my love bought me for my birthday? They screwed up in the mastering process; some of the audio tracks are mapped incorrectly. I called the number and they'll ship out the replacements when they're available.

Oops. Looks like they need some more quality control. I hereby volunteer to watch the next seasons _before_ they go to replication. I went through USC's film school, specialized in rerecording mixing, _and_ I'm super precise and picky. What more could they want? :)
