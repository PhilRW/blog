So dB’s 473 class and I are watching the complete _Empire Strikes Back_ last night and right when the mynoks start flying around the Millenium Falcon in the asteriod this huge ol’ moth starts dive-bombing us. Now I usually don’t mind most insects, but moths just creep me out. They’re stupid, ugly, clumsy, and this one was biiiig. It settled down after the action sequence, though, possibly having been riled up out of support for its larger space based brethren.
