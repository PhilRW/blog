Well I’m back in Denver for the summer. Have been for a while now, just too lazy (honestly) to write anything in this blog.... which I doubt people actually read anyway.

I’m looking for production work and so far it’s a no-go. There appear to be few opportunities for production students like myself in the Denver area. But I have decided that while I may not be working I can still be working on other things. For example, writing, researching, getting into shape (heh, yeah, right), and visiting family are all viable alternatives. I have been performing maintenance on my car lately. Ya-hoo.
