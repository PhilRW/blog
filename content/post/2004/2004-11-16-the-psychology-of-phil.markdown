I'm no psychoanalyst, but I'm in an introspective mood at the moment and feel the need to analyze myself. I'm wondering what it is about me that keeps me from finding someone with which to share my life. Why have I not allowed people in to my existence? Are my standards too high? If so, why? Am I somehow afraid of what a relationship might bring? Am I afraid of being hurt? Have I just not met the one? Or have I and not realized it? (Hopefully "...yet?") Why so many questions? I may be technically proficient at anything I attempt to master, but when it comes to personal relationships I find myself falling short. I know I have the capability to love -- as I've been there before -- unfortunately it was non-reciprocal. So I just have to wait I guess. But you know what? I'm tired of waiting. So universe, if you're listening to me right now, I could really use a break. Cut me some slack, okay? Send me a girl who's as interested in me as I could be in her. She doesn't have to be perfect, just perfect for me. And by that, I mean someone who's interested in me and not afraid to show it. Hmm. Maybe everyone's interested in me and I just can't pick up on it because it's been that way for as long as I can remember. Hah. Yeah, right. I wish. At any rate, I'm tired of making the phone calls and sending the e-mails. These are my rules: I'll give the girl a chance. And a second chance. Heck, maybe even a third chance. But if she shows no interest in me, no matter how cute or clever or magnificent I may find her -- yes, I know it's hard, but I've gotta do it -- I'm going to have to let her drift away. It's not worth the time out of my life to waste on someone who does not even realize that I'm the best catch for her there is out there. And that's my new philosophy.
