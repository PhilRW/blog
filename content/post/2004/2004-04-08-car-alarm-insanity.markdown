There is a car parked across the street from my apartment for the last week now. It has a car alarm that goes off an average of at least once every half hour. Anything and everything apparently sets it off: passing busses, helicopters, airplanes, and stupid cars with their stupid ghetto noisy exhaust mufflers. I want to smash that car, throw a stick of lit dynamite under it, run it over with a bulldozer, drop it off a cliff, anything to get that DAMNED NOISE TO STOP! It’s driving me f\*cking insane! It’s the worst car alarm system in the world! I just want the noise to stop!!! :frowning_face:
