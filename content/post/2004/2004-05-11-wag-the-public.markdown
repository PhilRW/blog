Doesn’t it seem convenient that this Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal has prompted violent retribution from the radical militant Islamic groups? Now this soldier found in the conveniently extremely well documented prisoner abuse photographs says she was ordered to pose that way? I think she and others like her are going to take the fall as patsies. The US will take the blame but before any more major reforms can be made there will be more retribution from terrorist cells and/or the US will counter-retalliate and we’ll see a major clampdown and possibly an excuse to postpone the June 30 handover. Or at least another major offensive in the Middle East focused towards yet another scapegoat. And while we’re on the subject of beheadings, why are we allies with Saudi Arabia? Does the Bush administration really believe that we’re stupid enough to believe that we’re fighting a war for “freedom” while at the same time they say things like “We have to worry about the menace, not the morals.” Give me a break! You know what, forget about it, just go fill up your car and buy some stuff.
