M. Night’s most consistent film yet, it adriotly plays with our
expectations and preconceptions. And if the technical aspect of the
theatergoing experience is up to snuff you might actually get to fully
enjoy the movie. (...If the projector’s bulb evenly lights the screen,
and remains consistently bright, and the film doesn’t pulsate in &
out of focus in the third reel, and the right and right surround
speakers are turned up, and the speakers are of decent quality, and the
noise of the projector is sufficiently muffled.)
