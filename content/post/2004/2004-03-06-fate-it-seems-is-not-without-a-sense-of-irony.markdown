The Returning Resident Renewal program here at USC (sounds like some kind of recycling program) is as convoluted and bureaucratic as anything else the university has to offer. I was hoping for a better (subjective term around here) apartment next year. I ended up signing a contract for the _exact same room_ that I have now. But hope is not lostâ€”the reassignment procedure begins on the 31st. Bully!
