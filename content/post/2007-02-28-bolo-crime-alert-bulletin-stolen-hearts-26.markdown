I like posting random personals ads that I come up with so they don’t get lost into internet oblivion. I had an inspiration the other day and I just had to write this one. Not a great response, but I didn’t expect any. I just posted my creativity in the appropriate forum. :)


<blockquote>—- BULLETIN—BE ON THE LOOKOUT:—-
