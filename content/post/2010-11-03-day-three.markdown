I continue in eternal exile. The landscape does not change, in fact at times the winds blow even colder than I could have imagined. There is no hint at additional light and, in fact, the spans of what little dimness there is seem to grow shorter. The worst may yet be ahead. I drift aimlessly in and out of consciousness, parched, panged with hunger, waiting for a sign.
