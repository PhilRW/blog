Can the AP colossally fuck up the facts any worse than it has? [Their story](http://www.denverpost.com/2017/07/03/tesla-model-3-on-sale-friday/) says:


<blockquote>Tesla says its keenly awaited Model 3 car for the masses will go on sale on Friday.</blockquote>


This is _just fucking wrong_. Elon Musk said in [this twitter post](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/881751358407299072):


<blockquote>Expecting to complete SN1 on Friday</blockquote>


SN1 = Serial Number 1. The first production vehicle. **Nowhere** does he say that they're going on sale this Friday. He says they _expect_ to complete the first production vehicle on Friday. He [goes on to tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/881755501905588226):


<blockquote>Handover party for first 30 customer Model 3's on the 28th!</blockquote>


As one of the first plebs to reserve the chance to order a Model 3, I would be quite well aware when they were being made available for sale to the general public. **Not yet**.

Get your shit together, AP. You really suck right now. Also, 215 miles _is not_ 133 km:


<blockquote>Tesla says the five-seat car will be able to go 215 miles (133 kilometers)</blockquote>


Jesus Fucking Christ!!

A coworker and I have a running joke about how awesome the world would be if everybody just did their jobs. Not even 100% of their jobs, just _most_ of their jobs _most _of the time. This piece of garbage doesn't deserve to be called news. Certainly not facts.
