Another full house tonight. They weren’t as loud as last night but
they did enjoy the show—a good crowd overall. Deb skipped more than half
of the first verse in “Wernher Von Braun,” she said the pages stuck
together and she panicked. Also the martini glass broke on the stem when
I set it down on the prop table US of the piano. More noise from
backstage—props clunking and people talking/whispering—but I don’t
remember exactly when.
