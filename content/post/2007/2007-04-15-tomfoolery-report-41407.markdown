Two shows: the matinee was mostly full and the evening show was sold out. I’d say the afternoon crowd was more raucous but both were good audiences. There was a hot repatch during the first show where the nuke lights came on early for a short while just as I was introducing a number in Act II. In the evening show Deb made a verse of “Irish Ballad”
just one lyric repeated over and over again: “She cut her baby brother in two, (rickety-tickety-tin), she cut her baby brother in two, she cut her baby brother in two, and served him up as an Irish stew, and invited the neighbors in.” Hmm. That was interesting.
