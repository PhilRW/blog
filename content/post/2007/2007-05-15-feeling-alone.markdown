It's true what they say: you never really know what you have until you don't have it anymore. Humans need physical touch to survive. Studies have shown that babies that aren't held and touched, even though they may be physically healthy otherwise, die. It's the same with grown-ups. But for some reason the grown-ups tend to complicate things so that they can't have that physical intimacy, or they can only have it under certain circumstances, or they have other priorities or other things to do, or they have other hang-ups.

This post is a downer, I know. I'm feeling depressed and sad at the moment and I need to get it out. I hurt right now. But this time merely expressing my anguish shall not alleviate it. Everyone says that you always find someone when you're not looking. But how can you not look unless you've already found someone? Or you're simply not interested? So tell me, dear universe, how can you find someone when you _are_ looking and you _don't_ have someone? Should I just give up? And not give up in a I'm-giving-up-but-more-like-just-to-psych-myself-out-in-the-hopes-of-finding-someone-but-that'll-never-work-because-I-know-that-deep-down-I-really-do-want-to-find-someone sort of way, but really just give up?

God I'm lonely.

Right now I just ... want ... someone ... to hold me. That's all.
