title: I Could Have Died Yesterday

Well, technically, I could die any day. But those of you who know me
know that I am not prone to hyperbole. When I went downstairs in the
morning after my mom had left, I smelled something burning or something
that had burned. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it but I just figured
that she had burned some toast. It was not until later in the day that I
found what had caused the smell: there was a burn mark across the wood
trim next to the kitchen window. My mom had left a makeup-type
magnifying mirror pointing skyward in the windowsill and it had focused
the sun’s rays and burned a line across the wood as the sun moved. Had
the mirror been in a slightly different place it could have ignited a
drape, setting the whole thing off and burning down the house. That’s
one for CSI! 




I say “could have died” because recently we replaced the batteries in
most of the smoke detectors on the upper floor. So most likely I’d have
escaped with my life and my underwear.




I’ll post a picture later.




Of the burn, not the underwear.
