This condo where I’m staying is the only place I’ve ever been that
has the mattresses wrapped in plastic. And it’s not the plastic that
comes with the mattress but a specially made vinyl cover. It’s
uncomfortable, it’s noisy, and the sheets slide off of faster than...
well, ducks and water. I know why they’d do it, but why would they do
it?
