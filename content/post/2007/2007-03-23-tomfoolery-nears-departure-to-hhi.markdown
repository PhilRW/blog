Today is our last day in Clemson. Well we rehearse in Pendleton actually. Tomorrow am we head to Hilton Head Island. Tonight we do a complete run-through of the show for a guest audience of four. Perhaps I should call it a smash through of the show. :slightly_smiling_face:

We open next Thursday night. The first act is 45 minues and the second act is 40 minutes. I wish we had a band and an extra cast member but we’ll have to make do with me plus three plus Mr. Yamaha’s 88.
