My last post inspired me to write a letter. So I'm publishing it in the hopes that my addressee surfs the internet and reads my blog.

Dear Universe,

You have been very kind to me in this lifetime. I'm not complaining. I have food, shelter, all the basic physical things to maintain life in this space and time. I also have more than many: I have a good education, some fun toys to play with, and some incredible gifts to use in this lifetime. In fact, sometimes I think you might have cursed me with too many gifts. Is that my ball and chain this time around? I can do just about anything I set my mind to, and I have a great intelligence and capacity for learning. I also have the gift of music in my heart and head, so thanks for that.

But this is not a love letter. I'm writing to ask you a favor. I'm tired of being alone. Yes, yes, there are some who say that we are never truly alone. But there are others who say we are always alone no matter where we are or whom we are with. Which one are you? Anyway, back to my dilemma. It's been almost 27 years now. Is there something I must do to find someone? What part of me needs to change and I'll change it -- as long as it means not being alone anymore. Wait, let me clarify. I don't _want_ to change but if that's what it takes to find somebody then I'll do what I must.

See, I'm a human, and I have physical needs. I don't have much emotional baggage and I like to think I could get along with lots of people but in reality I'm probably really picky. Is that why I'm alone? Or perhaps I'm too much of an introvert? 75 percent of the world is extroverted so already my odds ain't that great.

Anyway, I'm just writing humbly to ask that perhaps if you chance to run across the right woman for me, could ya send her my way? You know, just if you happen to bump into her. I mean, after all, you _are_ the universe.

Thanks for your time.

Sincerely,
