For some reason I was in a Star Trek gift shop in some basement corner of some casino somewhere and I was looking around, not particularly satisfied. Then I was walking back with my dad and I put a couple quarters in a lone slot machine and I won 1,000,000 credits ($250,000), the four lights on top lit up from left to right, and the machine made the classic winning ringing sound. Then a stocky casino employee lady came by shortly thereafter and started counting me out my money since I wanted to cash in. Meanwhile my dad was calling for me because I'd stopped to put the quarters in on the way back to the gift shop and I remember thinking that I could now pay off my car repairs, student loans, and put some money in the bank.

But upon waking up my first clue was that my dad was dead and I hadn't won the money.
