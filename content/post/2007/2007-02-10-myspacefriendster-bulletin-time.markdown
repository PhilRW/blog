Here’s a fun personals ad that I thought up. I posted it as a bulletin on MySpace and Friendster so my friends can get a kick out of it. :) Who knows, maybe they’ll pass it along to their cute actor friends (who get the joke). At the very least I would hope it demonstrates my creativity and sense of humor.


<blockquote>**NOW CASTING: g/f role for new reality
**OPEN CASTING CALL for a new reality, “My Girlfriend” Producer/director now holding ongoing open auditions for the following role:

MY GIRLFRIEND (F): Mid to late-20’s, cute, “girlfriend type.” Spunky and upbeat recurring supporting role, with a possibility for contract extension and upgrade to leading co-starring role. Not a lot of lines from leading man but very good screen time. Mostly improvisational dialogue. Some singing/dancing may be required and must move well. Comedic timing is a plus and any special skills will be considered on an individual basis. There is no pay. Credit, copy, and some meals provided. Callbacks TBA. Role open until filled.

ALSO CONSIDERING:

MY GIRLFRIEND’S MOM (F): 50’s to 60’s, family matriarch. Friendly and composed with a no-nonsense attitude towards her daughter’s suitors.
