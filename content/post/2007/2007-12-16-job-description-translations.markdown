Here’s a rough translation matrix for those of you out there looking through job listings online and otherwise.

Fast paced and fun work environment:  
_Crazy busy and chaotic_

Competitive pay:  
_Competitive for us: you get just over minimum wage and definitely not a living wage._

Excellent opportunities for advancement:  
_Start at the bottom and stay at the bottom until someone above you dies or has a psychotic break. We don’t care about any degrees you may have._

Sales contest awards:  
_If you don’t sell enough then you’re fired._

Discounts on merchandise:  
_This is to discourage you from stealing from us since we obviously don’t value our employees enough to give them real benefits._

Paid training:  
_Mandatory, time wasting training... if you ever want to even be considered for a promotion._

Candidates must have high energy:  
_Employees work really awful hours._

Candidates must be able to multitask:  
_We’re understaffed and you’ll be overworked._
