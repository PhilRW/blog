We’ve been working on _Tomfoolery_ for about a week now and we have about a week of rehearsals left. Sometimes it’s hard to imagine that this show will come together at all. The people can do it, it’s just a lot of songs to learn at one time. I’m a bit tired and I wish I had more than a single day off (on Monday). I have several other things I’d like to be doing, but I’m here for a job and I have precious little free time which I must reserve for down time to recharge for the next day’s rehearsals.

The hospitality is great and the weather is pleasant. I look forward to getting to the beach.
