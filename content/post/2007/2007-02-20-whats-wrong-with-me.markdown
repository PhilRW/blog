My answer is _nothing._ And yet why am I so unhappy being single and alone? I have a good life and I'm blessed in many ways. There are people in this world who have much bigger problems than being lonely. So I really shouldn't complain.

But then why do I feel so sad?

I know how to get almost everything else that I want. But I don't know how to make people want me in return. Why does that suck so much? I'm ready for a relationship, for love, for all those great things. It just ain't happening.

Am I destined to be alone forever?

_Think positive, Phil. Be patient._

Blah, blah, blah. Right now I have no patience and no positivity. I've used up all of my patience. I've had patience for 26 years and nothing happened. I don't think continuing by doing the same thing is going to change my results. That's the definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.

_So, change._

Yeah, that's easy to do.

_No one said it would be easy._

I can't change who I am and I won't change who I am for someone else. I like who I am.

I just want someone else to like who I am, too.

:frowning_face:

_Oh, can it, Phil. No one wants to hear your stupid whining anyway. We all feel down every once in a while. Get over it._

_Sometimes it's possible to make no mistakes and still lose._
