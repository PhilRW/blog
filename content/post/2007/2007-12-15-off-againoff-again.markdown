I'm about ready to give up on using the net to meet people, again. So many flakes out there. And I'm not just saying that because it snowed here today. I mean, women say they find you interesting or reply to your emails or whatever and then... nothing. They either flake out and forget about you or, more likely, they just decide that they just don't like you for some reason or another and simply give you the silent treatment by no longer replying to your emails. The thing I can't figure out is: why would someone decide she doesn't like you _before_ she ever meets you? It makes no sense to me. Attraction isn't based on mutual interests or something you read on a myspace profile. It's based on chemistry, physical interaction, and interpersonal human contact, not impersonal email.

Women say they want particular qualities and shared interests, but that has _nothing to do with attraction_ and I wish some women would figure this out. Now I'm not going to set up a first date with someone who has nothing in common with me whatsoever, but as long as we have a few things in common then I don't see what the big deal is! These women who claim they won't "settle" for anything less than their visions of perfection probably have _no idea_ what their mates will be like. And it's too bad for them, because the internet gives them a false sense of control: a screen through which they can sift the superficially incompatible males. These women, who are not open to meeting men who don't fit into their mental mold, may find what they want, but ultimately will not find what they need. That is unless romance plays no part in their plans.

So I say so long for now to the world of meeting women online. I've had a few responses from my latest round of craigslisting, so I'll just have to wait and see if any of them pan out. I wish I had a job or a hobby where I met lots of women in real life. I'm not in any shows now and my dance class is not suitable for that purpose. I don't like drinking and I'm not a fan of noisy, crowded bars. Perhaps I'll take up a cooking class. Or just stop looking.
