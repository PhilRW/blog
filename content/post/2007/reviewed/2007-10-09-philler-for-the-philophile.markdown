Wouldn’t it be phunny iph all words that had an “f” sound actually were spelled “ph?” Some pholks would say that was phantastic. Being a Phil myselph I would have a terriphic time making phun of pholks who used the letter “f.” Aphter a phine amount oph time this pharcical phanciness would become phamiliar to everyone and once used enouph by everyone, the unusual spellings would be “fish” and “freak.” Then things like pharts and phlatulance wouldn’t be so ophensive phor some phancy phellows who are phinely rephined. This blog entry is just a philler phor to take up extra space. It has no real purpose. But iph you like it, pheel phree to comment yourselph.
