Full house for our 2nd Friday night. They were a good crowd to start but they eventually cooled off by the end of Act II. Nobody went up on any lines or lyrics. A classmate of Tom Lehrer’s from Harvard was in the audience tonight. Nick’s mother and brother also showed up. Pat said there was a strange light that came on tonight DSR when it was supposed to be only on the piano CSL for “Dope Peddler.” Also the light cues during “Hunting Song” were early again tonight.


Hank said we’re adding a 1500 matinee next Saturday as we’ve sold over 1100 tickets so far.
