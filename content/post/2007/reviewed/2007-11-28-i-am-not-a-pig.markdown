I’m all for condom use. Let me say that up front. But have you seen this Trojan “evolve” TV ad with the pigs? Yes it’s clever, but something about it doesn’t sit well with me. Every time I see it I just get irked. Perhaps it’s the message that all men are portrayed as pigs. Only after a pig purchases a Trojan condom does he turn into a man, suddenly becoming attractive to the woman at the bar. Plus obviously none of the women are interested in these pigs in the first place, so what should be the impetus for one of them to even buy a condom? Is he delusional?

This ad just makes me mad. It’s irresponsible and says the wrong thing. Not about STD prevention or birth control because—believe me—I’m a big supporter of both of those things, but because of the cavalier attitude it takes towards members of my gender. I’m just angry to be insulted, that’s all. I’d be just as peeved if it sold body spray, deodorant, cologne, hair products, clothing, or anything eise. Heck, it _could_ be used to sell anything else. That could be said about a _lot_ of ads these days. But that’s a rant for another time.

Does this ad play off of or into cultural stereotypes? Does the commercial say that men should be the only ones responsible for protection? Why are none of the ladies in the bar anthropomorphized bitches? How about a companion ad where all of the women _are_ bitches? How would they feel about that?
