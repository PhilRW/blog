Someone else now has [a blog](https://philsosophies.wordpress.com/) with the title “phil’s osophies.” Looks like it was started on or around December 7, 2006. However his does not have the cool little ™ symbol; that should distinguish us. :)

Wordpress is a good platform for blogging. I experimented with it a while ago, during my days of wild webserver software experimentation.
