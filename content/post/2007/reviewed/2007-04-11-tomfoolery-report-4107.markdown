Best crowd _ever_ tonight! They laughed at everything, even when not appropriate. Or rather, especially when not appropriate. Full house. Hank said that about 35 of them booked months ago as soon as they learned of the Tom Lehrer show. Only flub was Nick saying “friendship” instead of “love” before “I Got It from Agnes,” but he covered well. Oh yes, also Robin added a couple beats in a measure of “New Math.” I did have to shush the excessive noise backstage _during_ my song “She’s My Girl.” They really need to shut the heck up back there. I noticed a strip light bulb was burned out and replaced it after the show. We didn’t get a 5 minute warning for intermission. The gunshot light cues were much better tonight. Robin forgot that yesterday was Lehrer’s birthday so he was still 78/25C tonight. If Lehrer were alive today, he’d be rolling over in his grave.... Oh, er, nevermind.

Overall, best show yet and best crowd yet.
