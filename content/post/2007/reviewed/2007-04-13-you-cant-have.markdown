```
i gave her my heart
i gave her my core
i have her the essence of everything i was

and she took it
and she teased it
and she crushed it so gentle

and now i'm alone
and now i'm afraid
and now i'm angry at all the mistakes i've made
and now i'm angry at her stupid games

and i'll never be
the same
again

i'll never want to love another

i'll never want to capitalize or punctuate
because i think why bother

and i deserve more
did i deserve this?
i deserve love
and i deserve bliss

and she doesn't...me
because i am mad
and i could hurt

and i do hurt

so


sorry charlie
them's the brakes
some folks cry
others fume
i fume
now
    
but you can't have my heart back
```
