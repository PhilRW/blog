Last night was our final dress rehearsal. We didn’t make any of our old mistakes—instead we made all new mistakes. I guess that’s progress. Anyway, the four people in our preview audience proved to be a somewhat anemic crowd, but opening night promises to be different. Hank tells us that we’re sold out tonight and tomorrow night and they have never sold out an opening night performance before. So I hope the audience likes it.

Two hours until I leave for the theater. Time enough to.... I dunno. Finish this blog entry and do some surfing, personal grooming, and a bit of nutritional sustenance before curtain.
