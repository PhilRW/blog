Sometimes when I sit down to play the piano for myself, I wish there was somebody else there to listen. Someone to sit quietly and to enjoy the occasionally beautiful music I play. I would like to touch her heart through the piano keys and move her to joy, anger, tears, elation. I put so much of myself into my piano playing at times, it’s a shame there’s nobody else around to listen. But I am very private about my music. It’s a very personal thing. 

Whoever my future wife is I hope she appreciates my music.

That is all.
