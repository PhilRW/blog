I have not been updating my blog lately because I’ve been busy. It’s a good busy. But it doesn’t leave much time for profound thoughts or whimsical observances. I have to prioritize, you know? Making money, paying taxes, eating, sleeping, memorizing lines. These things all take priority over ... this.

That reminds me: _I Hate Hamlet_ is coming up soon. Get yer tickets now! Or later. Just come see the show. It will be fun. 

Also, I’m going to be tapping my little heart out in _Thoroughly Modern Millie_ soon thereafter. I must be crazy to be rehearsing two shows at once.
