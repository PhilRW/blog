I’m starting to wonder if I’ll ever meet the right woman for me. How hard is it to find a beautiful, intelligent, honest, and reliable woman who doesn’t act like a little kid? I’m the male equivalent of all those things, so I expect what I have to offer in return. I haven’t dated much so rejection hurts. Even if I had dated a lot, rejection still hurts. Being alone hurts. There’s this pain, this hole in the middle of my chest. Sometimes I can patch it up with work and distractions, other times I’m so sad that I cry myself to sleep: just out of the pain of always having been alone. But I know who I am and what I want. I’m confident, intelligent, and handsome. And, quite frankly, I can afford to be a little picky. Looking back on my dating track record over the past few months, I haven’t found “the one” just yet, but now that I think about it, each and every woman who has gotten to know me finds me desirable or interesting in some way or another. There’s J, A, C, M, and K. Plus many others who haven’t even met me yet. The ones who met me wanted to see me again. So I have to be picky. I can’t afford to go after the first woman who shows interest in me without further scrutiny. She has to pass muster. **Then** well see what happens....

You gotta have a strong net to catch _this_ fish, baby.

I look forward to meeting you, beautiful woman, light of my life. Let me share with you all that I have to offer. Let me give you my heart, my body, my soul. Everything that I am is yours. Won’t you please come find me? You can reach me via phone, fax, email, postal mail, or in person, wherever I am. I’m out there. And so are you. Let’s meet and share our lives together. Let us live an eternity intertwined.
