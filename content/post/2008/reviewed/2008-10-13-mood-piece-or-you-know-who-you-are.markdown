I’ll write you this poem  
As my way to show ‘em  
The highest you hold little piece of my heart

A lilt and a beat  
A jig with my feet  
Do dance with me lightly and slightly apart

My life on a string  
My smile does sing  
A happier story remaining in sight

Forget about worry  
Keep not in a hurry  
Enjoying each moment I’m within your light

For pleasanter days  
I exit this haze  
And plot a course starward, escaping the night

Then spotting an end  
Becoming a friend  
The end and beginning are one in the same

So hold true to self  
Be good, little elf  
For nothing, there is, as they say, like a dame

(That’s not the best ending, ‘twas rather quite lame  
A different meter to finish the game?)  
The curse of the verse is most likely to blame

Tweet. Tweet.
