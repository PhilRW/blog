To the crazy lady who thinks she can waltz into and out of my life at her own discretion:

You have to give a little to get a little. I don’t have time to play games. I understand you’re busy, but so am I. We all make time for what is important to us. So I understand where I am with you. Not by your words but by your (in)actions. I hope you can learn this as you grow on your journey.

Best of luck to you. Maybe I’ll be able to help you.

Maybe not.
