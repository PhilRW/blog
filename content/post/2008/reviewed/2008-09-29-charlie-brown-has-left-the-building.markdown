The show is over. _Charlie Brown_ plays no more. What am I to do with myself? No new shows on the horizon.

Who knows? Maybe a beautiful girl will fall out of the sky into my life.

And maybe we’ll have world peace and end world hunger and find a cure for cancer and pixie dust will make people fly.

Hey—it could happen!
