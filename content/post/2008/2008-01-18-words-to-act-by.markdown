It is not what we say but how we behave that defines us in the eyes of others. At some point talk must become action. When what we say does not reflect what we do, and vice versa, we cannot ever hope to foster the growth of trusting and mature adult relationships.

My word is my bond. I do not break it lightly. In matters of importance I make no promises I intend not to keep. Feeling-sparing fibs may feel better in the moment, but honesty is always best for long-term gain. Paint yourself in the best light: the light of truth. One can only be honest about himself to the degree he knows himself. Know thyself to help others to know you. Make compromises for the sake of truth and knowledge and communication. Do not put your needs above those of others and both sides will win.
