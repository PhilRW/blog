title: An Overgeneralized Ramble on the Universal Stock Exchange

All gain comes at the cost of loss. You cannot get something without giving up something. Even that which we perceive as free replaces something, even if what we only previously perceived in that space was a void of emptiness. A void is something, too. And inactivity is just as valid as activity insomuch as it occupies space and time and requires dedication for proper execution.

All gain/loss exchanges must be in balance. As you cannot get something for nothing, that something shall come at an equal expense. Either side of the transaction may be physical or emotional, it may be a sacrifice of time, it may be an exchange of stress or mental energy. Energy and matter can be transformed but not created or destroyed.

Perhaps we do not perceive all exchanges as fair. Perhaps they are not. But we are not to confuse fairness with equality. Just as we cannot know joy without sorrow, light without darkness, nor wealth without poverty, neither can we gain without sacrifice.

What do we have that is so important to us? Is it merely that we are comfortable with its companionship that we hesitate to part company with our present reality for another unknown? To embrace the unknown gleefully tends against the nature of human security. We do not wish for change therefore we hold on to what we have and seek out that which is familiar to us. That which is unfamiliar to us only becomes familiar through discomfort.

Perhaps the human condition is only motivated to change through discomfort. Only when something becomes more painful than pleasant to us do we seek out change. Pure biological stimulus response. It has been said that there are two motivating factors in human existence: seeking pleasure and avoiding pain.

Well that's quite enough pointless pedantry for now. I fear this post may be more for the sake of reading my own writing than anything else more noble.
