This morning my back was hurting, so while I waited for the chiropractor to open so I might possibly make an appointment for ASAP, I decided to work from home.

Then the neighbor's dogs started barking. They started barking at 07:32. And they did. not. stop. So I decided to get dressed as quickly as possible and walk to work, despite the back pain. I made it half-way down the block and had turn around in agony. So I decided to drive because I could not walk to work and I could not stay and live IN MY OWN HOUSE BECAUSE I AM BEING ASSAULTED BY MY NEIGHBORS. So, crying in misery, shaking in pain, I stumbled into the car and drove the 2 minutes to work.

I WANT THE NOISE TO END. PLEASE GOD, LET THE BARKING STOP! I'LL DO ANYTHING AT THIS POINT!! CAN I TAKE A PILL THAT MAKES ME DEAF?! CAN I BUILD A 15-FOOT HIGH NOISE WALL AROUND MY PROPERTY?! I WILL DO ANYTHING!!!
