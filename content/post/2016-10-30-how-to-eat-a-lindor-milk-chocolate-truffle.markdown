title: How to Eat a Lindor Milk Chocolate Truffle
wordpress_id: 86228
---

These chocolates are smooth and delicious, and relatively expensive. Due to a happenstance of climate I recently found that when I bit into one that appeared solid, the interior had melted. What was initially disappointment has now turned into my favorite method of consumption, and would like to share how to recreate it with you. Note: I developed this technique on the milk chocolate variety; other flavors may not work as well, if at all.



	
  1. Decide that you want to enjoy a milk chocolate truffle.

	
  2. Remove the truffle you want to enjoy from the bag.

	
  3. Place it lightly in a pocket (or hold it in your hand, but this will take a while): it should be close enough to warm using your body heat, but be careful not to squish it with too much pressure.

	
  4. Wait until they no longer feel as cool to the touch, but closer to skin temperature.

	
    1. If you wait until the outer shell starts to melt (you will be able to feel it through the wrapper), it is _too warm_! ABORT! ABORT!




	
  5. Unwrap the truffle.

	
  6. Place the truffle entirely in your mouth: _do not bite it in half_.

	
  7. Bite into it slowly until the outer chocolate layer has been fractured enough to allow the now molten interior chocolate to come through.

	
  8. Enjoy the rest as desired. If I'm in a contemplative mood, I will often let the outer layer melt in my mouth long after the center has flowed away.


These instructions may sound silly, but I believe that Lindt very specifically made the center of the truffle liquefy at a lower temperature than the exterior. For the best experience, you cannot heat them too fast (e.g., with a microwave). The trick to consuming them is to find the perfect temperature where the outside is still solid but the inside is now liquid.

Could you warm them in your mouth? Theoretically, yes, if you have the willpower. But at mouth temperatures the outer layer will likely melt away before the core has a chance to liquefy.

Enjoy!
