Colorado sends mail-in ballots. Typically I vote early. I'm going to change my strategy for the next Super Tuesday.

I voted for someone who dropped out last-minute. And since we're idiotic and don't do [ranked-choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) voting, my vote is now worthless.

Next time I'm going to wait until the morning of and drop my ballot in the ballot pick-up box on the way to work.

By the way, I still [predict](/2019/05/30/conditional-prediction) a Democratic loss if Biden gets the nomination.
