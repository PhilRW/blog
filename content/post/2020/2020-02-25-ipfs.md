This website is now on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io). What does that mean for you? Well, nothing, really, unless you're cool enough to run your own IPFS node/gateway.

What does that mean for me? A few extra steps when updating the website. I'll work on automating it. Maybe.

Here are a couple of ways to find this site on IPFS:

* Install [IPFS Desktop](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/releases) and then acccess it via [dnslink](ipns://blog.rosenberg-watt.com) (requires IPFS Companion for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipfs-companion/nibjojkomfdiaoajekhjakgkdhaomnch) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ipfs-companion/) to be running in your browser).
* Via a [gateway](https://ipfs.rosenberg-watt.com/ipns/blog.rosenberg-watt.com). Kinda defeats the purpose of having a distributed model, though.
