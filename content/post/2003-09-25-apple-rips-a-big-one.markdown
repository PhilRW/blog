After downloading and installing the Mac OS 10.2.8 update Monday afternoon, my ethernet connection drops. Initially I thought it was USC because this happened several times last year, but after four days of downtime I checked Apple’s website and it appears it was Apple’s fault. So I bought a hub as a temporary workaround until they can fix their own mess. I just hope they get a patch out within 14 days, as I can’t return the hub after that.

Meanwhile, USC doesn’t let us use hubs on the network so I can’t connect my other computer to it. It would be nice if they included more than one ethernet port in my whole apartment. I’m not about to buy a router.
