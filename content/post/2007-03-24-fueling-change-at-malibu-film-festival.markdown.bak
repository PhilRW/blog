Oh, by the way, my grad school doc _Fueling Change_ is an official selection at the 8th [Malibu International Film Festival](http://www.malibufilmfestival.org/).

If you’ve been paying attention to my schedule or blog then you know that I won’t be able attend this one. :-( But I’ll try to get a producer or a crew member to attend. I’m happy that more people will get to see the doc. It’s showing in Santa Monica on Sunday, April 15th at 11 am (check their website for more information). “Hmm... now should I do my taxes or go to a film festival” the Los Angelinos think....
