I post this not because it's interesting news, but because of the awful, awful writing in the article. I have excerpted the worst of the article in case you don't want to read the whole thing:


<blockquote>DeHerrera's wife — who told investigators she had been sexually assaulted by DeHerrera — fled the home when Edgewater police arrived with two of the children, ages 10 and five months.</blockquote>
