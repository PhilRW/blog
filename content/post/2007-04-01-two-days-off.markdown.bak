Yahoo! Two whole days off. That equates to about three full days from now getting back to the theater. What to do, what to do? I could hit the beach, go for a walk, or go out to eat. Or see a movie. Or... well, that’s about it.It’s supposed to storm Mon and Tues! Boo. But it’s nice today. So away I go from my computer.

I think we could all use a break from the show. It’s been three weeks since we’ve had more than a day away from the show. We’ve all got Lehrer on the brain.
