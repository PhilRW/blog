This blog is ill-suited to re-sharing other peoples' content. You know, interesting and/or funny links you encounter throughout the day and would like your friends and family to see, optionally with a comment of your own attached. The thing is, what do *you* use? Twitter? Facebook? Reddit? Are *they* on what you're on?

Well, if you want to consume what I'm sharing, you can now use the RSS reader of your choice (or go straight to the website, or get it delivered to your email). It's self-hosted and open source, of course:

I'll do my best to tag content so you can filter your feed by tags if you so desire. So if, for example, you only want my ["funny" feed](https://shaarli.rosenberg-watt.com/?searchtags=funny), you can ignore the other tags. :slightly_smiling_face:

And now I have two feeds. This blog and my [Shaarli links](https://shaarli.rosenberg-watt.com/). Subscribe at your own peril. :smiling_imp:
