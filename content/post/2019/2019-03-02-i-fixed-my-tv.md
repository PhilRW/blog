I fixed our 8-year old TV. It turned on and it had sound but no picture. I replaced something called the T-Con board and it worked again! The part cost $85 USD and I was fortunate enough to find it locally. Otherwise it would have been a $1000 trip to Costco and tossing a 60-inch screen in the recycling bin. :frowning:

I used the wide-angle lens for this picture. It's really larger than it looks. The T-Con board is in the bottom center, with its replacement part in pink bubble wrap next to it on the right.

Shout out to [TV Parts for Sale](https://tvpartsforsale.com/) for being local and having the part.
