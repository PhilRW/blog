title: I Feel Like I Should Write Something
wordpress_id: 67

I feel like I should write something
    This bright and sunny day.
    I feel like I should write something
    But I haven't much to say.
    
    I haven't posted in a while
    So maybe this will make you smile.
    (That is, if it's not a steaming pile.)
    Okay....
    
    Now I feel I have written something.
    
    ...But not really.
