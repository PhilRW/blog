Whatever happened to my friends' blogs? So many clever, articulate, funny writings no longer being written. Cousins, uncles, old friends, good friends, all silent. Months pass, then years, then eventually decades.

Beep.

I still subscribe to them in my [RSS reader](https://freshrss.org/) in the hopes that someday a new entry will appear.

Beep.

No new entries appear.

Next time, remember to pull the battery after ripping it from your wall.

Beeeeeeeuuuuuuaaaaa………..
