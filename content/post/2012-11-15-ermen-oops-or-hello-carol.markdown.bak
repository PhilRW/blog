_Hello, Dolly!_ 1964 Broadway cast recording, track 4 "Sunday Clothes," 2 minutes 50 seconds in. There is a short musical break and an "oops" by Carol Channing in the recording studio. The break is 8 measures long but Carol starts to say "Ermengarde" after only 4 measures. She stops herself but it's still on the recording. You can clearly hear her say "Erme--" in the right channel. Funny what kinds of things you notice when wearing headphones. :)
