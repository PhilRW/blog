Where do you live relative to the ball? Are you always behind the ball, reacting to what's happening, not anticipating where the ball will go? Or are you ahead of it, getting out of the way, forging ahead? Balls are pretty predictable once you understand them. But if you're always following them you will not be able to see your own path as clearly.
