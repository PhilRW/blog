I wish could say I had high praise for UPS. I wish I could say they delivered my package on time. I wish I could say they delivered my package. I wish I could say they got my package to my city. I wish I could say UPS knew where my package was. But I can't. As of right now the online tracking says "Exception." It was supposed to be delivered yesterday. I think customer support doesn't have any more information than what the online tracking website offers. They couldn't help me yesterday and they couldn't help me today. The only thing they said is I need to get in contact with the shipper and have him call UPS so they could start a trace.

This makes me angry. I would expect a shipping company to know how to ship. Or if something goes wrong to know what went wrong. But as it sits right now I don't know what the hell's going on and I'm furious because there's not a damn thing I can do about it. I can only hope that the package arrives here before I move out of town. In fact it absolutely has to: it's the trailer hitch for my car.
