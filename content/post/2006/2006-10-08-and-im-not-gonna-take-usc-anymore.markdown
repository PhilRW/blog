I felt like mangling Paddy Chayefsky’s quote because I’m sick of USC. Sick, sick, sick. They make me angry. It’s been over a year now and I STILL DON’T HAVE MY FRICKIN’ DIPLOMA. Sorry, FUCKIN’ DIPLOMA! I took all the courses, passed all the courses, but because of some stupid little paperwork error I haven’t yet received my blasted diploma. I think I’m going to call them once a day every day until this matter gets resolved, because this is just ridiculous.

Prospective USC students: the film school there is great, but bring a knife sharp enough to cut through all the red tape. Without it USC might just actually get something done once in a while.
