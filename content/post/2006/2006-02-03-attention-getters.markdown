It has come to my attention that... Doesn’t an opening line like that
carry a certain weight with it? I mean, when has someone ever started a
positive note with “it has come to my attention?” “It has come to my
attention that someone has been donating money to the Save the Children
Fund?” “It has come to my attention that the weather in Los Angeles is
constantly mild?” “It has come to my attention that Santa Claus is
coming to town?” Isn’t that rather like saying, “I regret to inform you
that your baby boy is healthy and alert?” Good potential for comic
misunderstanding.




This random thought of the day has been brought to you by the neurons in Phil’s cranium. Fire at will.
