title: Restrain My Heart

---

Restrain my heart from leaping forth towards every light it sees
my solitary soul yearns what my heart would deign appease

but soon it jumps too eagerly at every flitting chance
or even passing prospect of a tentative romance

restrain my heart for in its joys a thousand sorrows lie
in stirring of its passion best a hundred hopes do fly

restrain my heart for in the end it matters not upon
if loves light fight is won or lost as scarring wounds sting on

restrain my heart my shouts and pleas but fall upon deaf ears
my heart seeks only joy and love not bitterness and tears

and so for hope I carry on while sorrow pangs hang new
â€˜tis all a game this game of love of lust springs hope anew
