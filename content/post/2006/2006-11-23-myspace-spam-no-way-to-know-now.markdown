I just got three MySpace spams in the course of three minutes. What fun.

I would so much prefer MySpace to actually forward/redirect their messages to my e-mail address. Then I could filter it for spam myself based on the content/sender. But as it stands now, MySpace only sends you a notification of new messages and you have to log in to their blasted website to read the message. So my options are limited: 1) deal with the dumb notifications or 2) turn off notifications entirely, which I prefer not to do. I suppose the other option is to only accept messages from persons on my friends list, but I thought I did that already and the spam keeps coming through. Come on, MySpace, get your act together!

Some people have resorted to reporting the _notification_ email to their spam system. I know because my SpamAssassin headers list the messages as being reported by other people. But the notifications aren’t the problem: and that’s the problem! I’ve resorted to whitelisting anything from @message.myspace.com because of the problems inherent in the system.

Oh why aren’t all my friends on Friendster?  :)
