title: Sheâ€™s Not Sorry (rant)

All I want is an, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry for not consulting you when making a decision to bring a whiny puppy into your place of work thereby disrupting your ability to do work." I don't think people in this household understand that not only do I live here, but I work here as well. Bringing a new puppy into the house disturbs that. Is one supposed to be able to concentrate when the owner of the dog leaves it caged and it whines? Or when I walk past it on my quest to get some water and once I leave its sight it whines all over again for another ten minutes?! I **understand** that it has to be broken of its whining habits. But in so doing it breaks my habits. There's a good reason whiny animals aren't permitted in office areas (and I'm not just talking about complaining employees).

So please please please, have some consideration for your fellow human being and **at the very least** place his feelings _on the same level_ as your new, adorable, cute, cuddly, lovable... dog.

I don't want to hear argument. I don't want to hear you're right. **You're not.** Not when it comes to my feelings. I don't expect you to change. But I do expect you to at least **acknowledge** my existence. You don't have to like me more than your new canine companion. I don't expect you to. But I don't want to hear, "just deal with it," when you should know by now that whining dogs irritate the hell out of me. Almost as much as well-intentioned but ill behaved people.
