I just thought some of y’all might want to know about one of the best pizza joints in the Denver Metro area, [Rico’s Pizzeria](http://www.ricos-pizzeria.com/).

I don’t work for them nor have they compensated me for these words, except with their great food; I figured it was time I shared this little secret with the rest of the world. I’m addicted to their pepperoni subs. Next time you’re in Englewood, stop by. I always eat take-out but
go ahead and dine in if there’s room.
