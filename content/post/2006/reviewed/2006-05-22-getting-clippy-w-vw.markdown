Yesterday I was all ready to post a comment about how VW sucks because my window fell down yesterday on the freeway as the rain was moving in. And of course it was Sunday so I couldn’t get to the dealer until today. But fortunately they offered to fix it for me today for free as well as the driver’s side window if it is indeed the window regulator clips. And I’m confident that it will be. So VW doesn’t suck, after all. At least they have atoned for this particular sin—designing a plastic window clip that breaks more than occasionally. To their credit, they did put redesigned ones on the 2003+ cars.
