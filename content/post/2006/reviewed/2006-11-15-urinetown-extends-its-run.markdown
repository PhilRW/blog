You won’t hear the official announcement until Friday, but we’re adding 5 shows:

Friday, 12/8 @ 8pm,  
Saturday, 12/9 @ 8pm,  
Friday, 12/15 @ 8pm,  
Saturday, 12/16 @ 8pm,

You can also get 2-for-1 tickets to any of the Sunday shows BEFORE the extension (Sundays 11/19, 11/26 and 12/3 only) by calling the phone number on the [show’s website](http://www.urinetowndenver.org/) and saying, “Phil sent you.”
