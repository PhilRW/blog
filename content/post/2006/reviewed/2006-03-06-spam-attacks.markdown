I received 33 e-mail spams yesterday. Three of them the mail filter missed, and the other 30 were automatically placed in the Junk Mail folder. My thought is, if you’re going to send me unsolicited buik e-mail, at least use something halfway resembling grammar. I don’t respond well to phrases like, “Me and Dre had sat with himsrqfkov kicked it and had a chat with him.” Also, if spellings like “0ffffer,” “0nlllline,” L000king,” and “clllickk,” are supposed to get past the mail filter and trick me into believing in your product, it ain’t working.
