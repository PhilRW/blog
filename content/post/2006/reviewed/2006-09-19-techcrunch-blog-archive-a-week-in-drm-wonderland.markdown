As I prepare to put my own company’s media online, DRM and copyright keeps popping up in my head. I had the thought the other day, “what’s to keep tweenies from buying a show then posting it on YouTube for all the world to see for free?” That of course is just one poor example. But DRM is a huge issue. It’s not about large corporations being greedy but for me it’s about small corporations who plan to make their entire income online being kept afloat at all. I guess time will tell. But of particular interest, besides the interoperability comment (with which I wholeheartedly agree), is the bit on YouTube and copyrighted music. It would make the world a so much better place if noncommercial home videos could use copyrighted music for fun without fear of Big Music reprisal, their being given the option to veto the vid of course. But it doesn’t make commercial music licensing any much easier for me, which as of right now I anticipate to be the bane of my existance. That or I just avoid all nonorignal music anyway.
