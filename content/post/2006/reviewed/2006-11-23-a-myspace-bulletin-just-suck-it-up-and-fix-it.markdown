I thought I would save this from electronic oblivion. It’s a bulletin I wrote for my friends.

> You know what, folks, I’m just gonna say it. Honesty hurts sometimes but y’all need to hear it. I think you all are great, but some of you just need to fix your damn profile pages. I can’t read any of them. The designs are horrible. White text on a white background? Gimme a friggin’ break! Now I’m not saying you have to go to design school, but just step back for a minute and look at your pages objectively. I think it’s great that you want to post photos that are five times wider than any computer screen on earth, or the hot pink text color you found really stands out against that picture of a hot pink flower you have for your background (NOT), but just keep in mind that your friends who cannot see in INFRARED will not be able to read your profile pages without considerable headache and effort. There. I said it.

> When it comes to graphic design, there are times when more is more and there are times when less is more. MySpace is one of the latter. Just because you CAN do something with HTML doesn’t mean you SHOULD do something with HTML. Perhaps you could put that misplaced design enthusiasm towards CONTENT?! (And while you’re at it take a look at your grammar, punctuation, and little things that make reading words readable.)
