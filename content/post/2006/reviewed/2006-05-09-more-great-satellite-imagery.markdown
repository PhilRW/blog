I call this one “Center of Gravity.” MC Escher would be proud.

Well, okay, most of it was probably taken from an airplane flying at about 5000 ft. That’s why the downtown L.A. imagery is so patchwork. While it makes for a vertigo-inducing feeling Hitchcock would be proud of, I can’t help but think, “what are they thinking?!” What you really need is a super high altitude super high resolution super long lens that will give a persistent perspective across an area large enough not to skew the view on an area held on computer screen. Like a satellite. But any pictures are better than none, even if there is a perspective mismatch.
