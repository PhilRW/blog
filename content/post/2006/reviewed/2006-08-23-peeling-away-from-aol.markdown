The Onion did a radio news segment recently [on AOL e-mail](http://www.theonion.com/audio/aol-email-checked-for-old-times-sake,12738/). And although it was a joke there was a lot of truth to it. It’s unfortunate but every time someone gives me an e-mail address that ends with @aol.com, a little alert goes off inside my head that says “warning: this person hasn’t yet left their internet training wheels behind.” I used AOL at one time. It’s fine for anyone who doesn’t want to venture out onto the internet or for folks just getting started. But do not get AOL confused with truly being connected online. Not everybody has to host their own e-mail and web servers, but just be warned that “@aol.com” to many people means internet diapers.
