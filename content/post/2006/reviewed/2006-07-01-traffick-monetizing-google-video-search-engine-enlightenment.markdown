Presently Google Video seems only to be selling content from large content suppliers: networks, studios, and the like. [My company](http://www.neovisic.com/) is starting with one show designed specifically for the internet, so how will we sell on Google Video? Will we be forced to sell only directly on our website, losing customers in the process? It’s good for Google that they’re selling ad space in premium content to make it free to the public: I just hope the revenue’s a fair split.
