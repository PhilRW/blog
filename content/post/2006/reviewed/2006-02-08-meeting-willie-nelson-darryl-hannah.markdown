It was a lot of fun. I only got to shake their hands and present them with a copy of the movie, but it was a good experience nonetheless. They seem like nice people. And they support biodiesel. That Darryl Hannah, she’s a smart one. She’s well-versed in the facts on biodiesel. It’s too bad that we didn’t get her to appear in the doc or at least narrate. But it is what it is and I wouldn’t change it one bit. All of the crew worked so hard and did a great job.
