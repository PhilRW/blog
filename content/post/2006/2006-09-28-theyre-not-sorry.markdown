The vocal score for _Urinetown_ offers surprises, even from the very toughest amongst us. It demands great vocal agility from a former* Baritone, now assigned for the most part to Tenor 1. This means I sing, as written, anything from a low Ab to a high B. No kidding. Unfortunately most of the range sits on the high end. But that’s okay. It’ll still be a great show.

\* Former and future, after the show, of course.
