Does every web site in the world _have to_ start with “www?” This one doesn’t. And I fear if I tell people to go to “blog.rosenberg-watt.com,” they won’t understand that you don’t put a “www.” in front of it. At this point I think they’re just extra letters: a formality of the olden days of the internet, if you will. But they may be necessary. Are they?
