I’d like to place a reminder on my weblog. It’s aimed more towards the news media, who tend to be making a big stink about rising gas prices. Contrary to popular American belief, driving is a _privilege_, not a right. There is no constitutional guarantee to driving a car or receiving cheap gasoline prices from vendors. Let’s face it people, demand is rising and supply is falling. Anyone who took a high school economics class can tell you that prices will rise. And there’s nothing anybody can really do about it. Wait—there is. Don’t drive your car. Or use a renewable fuel that doesn’t come from crude oil. If you want a point in the right direction, watch _Fueling Change_. But stop your whining. What and how people drive around here you’d think it was their God-given right. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness doesn’t specifically mean driving a gas guzzling monstrosity down the road at 80mph while getting 10mpg. And if you’re one of those people who drives one of those cars and thinks, “oh, my fuel economy isn’t so bad,” you’re deluding yourself. I get 35mpg on average and I think _that’s_ bad. And you know what, it just might be. :)
