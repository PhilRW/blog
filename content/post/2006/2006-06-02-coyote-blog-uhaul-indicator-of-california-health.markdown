Renting U-Haul’s smallest trailer from LA to Denver would cost me $371. But if I were moving that same trailer from Portland, OR to LA it would cost me $26!!!. Wow.

If I had the time and the choice, I’d look for the metro area with the lowest U-Haul rates out of town and move there. It must be indicative of resident satisfaction or something.
