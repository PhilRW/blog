What's with all these companies wanting my review on a purchase or my opinion on a survey? I see no recompense for my time for all these thousands of papercuts. No, I will not review my purchase experience or take a survey on how to make you do your job better. Hint: if you want me to give you my time, please offer me something for it. I feel devalued with all of this crap.
