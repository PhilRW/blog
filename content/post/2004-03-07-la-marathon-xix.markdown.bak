I’m back from the Marathon. What fun. I was at mile 8 again this year
and not half an hour after I get there (0600) a bike rider goes down so
I call in LAFD through net control. Fortunately it was only a knee
laceration and she was on her way shortly—albeit slowly. The rest of the
day passed without incident (at least at my water station) and I made
it home before 1200. Next year I’m going to need either a high noise
environment headset for my VX-7R or a VHF Jedi series to interface with
my Mot boom headset. That probably doesn’t make any sense to almost
averyone. I’m tired. I got up at 0400 today. Nappy time....
