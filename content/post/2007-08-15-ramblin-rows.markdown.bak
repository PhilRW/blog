What am I doing right now. Oh you know, the usual. Dealing with the angst of living a post-postmodern existence.

What am I doing with my life? I’d like to think I’m doing _something_. _Anything_. I’m starting my own production company. No clients at the moment. I work part-time at a friend’s production company, helping get them off the ground. 12 bucks an hour for producing. You can’t even get a secretary for that much. I should ask for more money.

If only my business had enough income to hire another employee. That’d be fun. I look forward to that day.

And my personal life? Heh. What personal life? Let’s change the subject.

This blog entry is turning out to be no fun at all. Not for me writing it or you reading it. Whoever you are. It’s sort of a stream-of-consciousness with spell check and decent punctuation.

I can do _anything_. So why aren’t I doing _something_?

I want to make a difference in the world. Making videos for profit is okay, for fun is better, now if the two can be combined with a third... making a difference. For the better. And a lasting impression.

Doctors, lawyers, they change the world on a smaller scale. Politicians are so political they can’t get anything done anyway. Or can they? But filmmakers teach us to dream and guide our future (in fiction). Does the now and negative of the documentary influence us as much? How will the U.S. change from Moore’s _Sicko_? Will it? I hope so. Where’s our universal healthcare?

Why do I write in this blog when I really have nothing to say? I’m not a 14 year old girl writing about her cat. This blog’s been around for years. I guess it’s just a public journal of sorts, sitting on the internet as a chronicle knick knack, collecting dust in this corner of the net.

Today I went to _Hello, Dolly!_ rehearsal at a church. What is
it with rehearsals and churches? It was a nice church with a state-of-the-art electronic security system and TV in the choir room. I saved the position in my GPS as a waypoint called “ST ANDREWS.” There was no icon for a church so I used the “danger area” icon: a skull and crossbones.
