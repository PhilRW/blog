I need a refill on a prescription. This is the procedure.

<!--more-->

- The pharmacy I use says they need more info from the provider.
- I call the provider, they re-send the info.
- The pharmacy messes up the amount on the refill then says they don't have enough info from the provider.
- I find a new pharmacy that says they take my insurance.
- I call the provider and ask them to send the Rx to a new pharmacy.
- My provider sends the Rx to my new pharmacy.
- The new pharmacy says insurance doesn't cover the medication.
- I call the insurance company.
- They call me back and give me the number of the Rx benefit manager.
- I call the Rx benefit manager.
- They transfer me to another person in that company.
- That person says the medication is covered but my new pharmacy doesn't have a contract with them.
- I set up a mail order pharmacy account directly with the Rx benefit manager.
- I call my provider *again* and ask them to re-send the Rx to *another* new pharmacy.

And that's where we are as of now. This is what I expect to happen next:

- Everything goes smoothly.
