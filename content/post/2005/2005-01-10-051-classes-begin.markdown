This semester here’s what’s on the agenda: Advanced Sound, 581B (finishing Sound Design on Randy Riggs’ “Spaceboy”), Prepping the Documentary CTPR-531, and Script Analysis CTWR-516. Also I will lead SA (Student Assist) 546N Sound again and hopefully for the last time, and Kirk Sullivan will be my wingman as the second 546N Sound SA. In between all of this I shall do other miscellaneous and occasionally fun things of which yet I know little but expect much.
