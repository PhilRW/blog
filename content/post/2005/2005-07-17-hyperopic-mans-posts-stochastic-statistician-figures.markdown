So why does it help people to see better when they squint? Well, most people say that by reducing the amount of light entering your eye, you're essentially "stopping down" your eye, helping it to focus; it's the same principle as increasing the depth of field of a camera by closing the iris.

My eyes behave in that way, but in addition I have learned to focus my left eye with the pressure of my lower eyelid. When I squint my left eye in a certain way, it apparently reshapes the lens and makes it easier to focus. I can repeat this feat with a relaxed eyelid and the tip of my finger. This is regardless of the depth of field issue caused by the eyelashes reducing the amount of incoming light.

It's funny what you can discover when you're not otherwise occupied.

This fascinating tidbit brought to you by Phil.
