Kudos to Kevin for spotting an errant “begs the question” which I
subsequently changed to “makes me wonder.” Let us all band together to
stamp out errant grammar and mixed metaphors. Let us not put the chicken
before the horse and beat a dead dog, because nobody should count
blessings before they’re hatched. Also watch out for those singular
pronouns.




By the way, why doesn’t Kevin ever post comments here? The Arbiter
has had too much vinum? I await your reply forthwith. (If you put a link
to my site on yours, I will do correspondingly here.)
