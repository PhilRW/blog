Dear neighbor in apartment 33,




Please turn up your music! I love those loud, wall-shaking, hip-hop
beats, especially at 12 am when I have class the next morning. But as it
stands now, I can’t make out the words. It’s just a nondescript
thudding sound, unless I’m sitting in my favorite chair next to the wall
where I can sometimes make out those wonderful and witty lyrics. So
please, turn it up. Wake me up from my boring slumber and don’t think
about the welfare of your neighbor. That’s okay. When you hear that
thump-thump-thumping noise at 12 am but it doesn’t go with the beat,
that’s me at the door. Oh, I’m not angry at all. I’m coming over to
politely ask you to turn it up even more, so _all_ of our responsible and studious graduate student neighbors can share in the wonders of _your_
stereo system. Turn it up because the walls are too thick and too well
insulated to transmit any kind of sound. And while you’re at it, leave
it on even longer. Four hours per day is certainly not enough of your
diverse musical tastes.




Sincerely,




The ticking bomb in apartment 34
