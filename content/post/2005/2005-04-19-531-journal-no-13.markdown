Final journal entry. Self evaluation: I think I did pretty well. I was selected, so that must be a good sign. :) There are always things I could have done better. More rehearsal is the key for me. I think I came across as nervous in the first couple minutes -- and I was. I think Rebecca and I managed to find a good balance between the two of us talking on different aspects of the project. One thing -- I was surprised by the attentiveness of the audience. I guess I was used to the bleary-eyed semiconscious attention of my classmates during the in-class exercises, but having the whole room focused on the two of us was something else. Now comes the rest of the project -- and I wrap up one semester as I plan for another. It should be a lot of hard work and a lot of fun.
