Advanced Sound class went to visit Chris Jenkins at the Alfred Hitchcock theater at Universal last night. They’re just finishing printmastering for _The Interpreter_. We got to watch (and listen to) the first reel. Too bad I can’t say anything about the movie. Not that I don’t want to, but I’ll have to wait until April 22nd to give my thoughts on the film. (Or April 13 in Europe—weird, huh?) What I _can_ say is that the Harrison digital console they’re using at Universal looks like it’s going to shape up to be pretty awesome. It’s basically a prototype—it has some issues still to work out as they’ve only mixed two movies on it so far. It has waveform scrolling, 10-second cache looping (sans ProTools), plugins, and all sorts of Jenkinsised features. Anyway, it might be fun to work at Universal some day, starting possibly as a mix tech and hanging around their Blue Wave studios, where they do transferring, QC, remastering & digitizing, trailers, you name it. Chris says some folks who get a good start have musical backgrounds. I cerainly qualify for that. :slightly_smiling_face:
