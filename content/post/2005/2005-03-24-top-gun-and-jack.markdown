CTWR-516 Advanced Script Analysis w/ Jack Epps today. Awesome. We watched Top Gun, he told us some stories about it (and some about other stuff), people made a few jokes, we had fun. The print was in 2.35:1 and besides the right projector being a bit fast (my observation) everything went great. Although they should really check out the sound system in 108—something’s not right. Good class, good friends, good teacher, had a fun time, and learned in the process. Doesn’t get much better than this. :) And it only took me 6 semesters.
