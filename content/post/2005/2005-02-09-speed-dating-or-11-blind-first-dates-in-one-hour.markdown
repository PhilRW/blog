I think the title says it all. I went to this grad student senate sponsored speed dating thing tonight. It was scheduled to take two hours, but it took an hour for everyone to get nametags and get in the door, so we only got to meet 11 people of the opposite sex. And it’s not like you could choose whom to go to next, we just rotated up a number. So each “date” was about four minutes long, then the hosts blew a whistle and the guys had to rotate to the next girl. Then at the end you’re supposed to write down the names of people you’re interested in and they collect the forms; if there’s mutual interest then they get you in touch w/ each other.

It was exciting and depressing at the same time. At least it forced me to be social and work on my much neglected social skill set. I left disappointed yet none the worse for wear. _Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match...._ Ah well. It was fun and I really wasn’t expecting much of it. How many girls of the eleven did I put on my list do you ask? One. Am I being too picky? Yes? No? Can you answer that if you weren’t there? Anyway, on to homework. I have vocation-related things to do, further neglecting my social life.
