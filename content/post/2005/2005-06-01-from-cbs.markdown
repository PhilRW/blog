I realize I haven’t posted a new entry in a while so I thought I’d do it now. I’m sitting on Stage 16 on the CBS lot in Studio City, CA. They finally got us wireless internet access so I can make productive use of my time as a 2nd AD (e.g. write blog entries). I feel more productive when I have the internet. :slightly_smiling_face:

Anyway, _Four Degrees_ is going pretty well. Adam Lipsius is directing and Randy Riggs is producing. I found this software called Gorilla that helps manage the production, I think it’s good software. It’ll do cast/character breakdowns, breakdown sheets, call sheets, shoot scheduling, cast contact lists & call times, stripboards, day strips, budgeting, accounting, festival submission tracking, all that production stuff that needs to be managed. The software still needs some work but it’s the best thing that I could find out there at the moment.

So that’s just a bland update as to what I’m doing. I’ve been on this production since 5/21/05 and I’ll be on until 6/6/05. Then I go back to cutting sound for _Spaceboy_ for a while (and sleep in) and go back to Denver for a while. How exciting is that.
