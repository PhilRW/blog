Finally! The paper is done. Now on to the fun stuff. I'm not really worried at all about the oral presentation or the pitch tape, but I've been focusing so much on the proposal that we will see a rapid transformation from rough assemblage and presentation to refined visual assembly and presentation. I'm a bit concerned that the weather's been so durn nice that it might put a hamper on our plans to shoot smoggy skies. But we'll think of something. I am very grateful to have Rebecca to work with this early on in the process, and even more so because she's a great shooter. My only concern is that she's shot so much in the past that it will not be much of a challenge for her. I'm also a bit concerned that there are so many good things happening now with the doc that I'll basically have to find new people in the fall if it's selected as a 546. Well, okay, I have the whole summer to do that. It would just change some of the nature of the documentary, but hey, that's docs. I also need to spend more time on the humor and putting more of my personality and sensibilities into this project than I already have. It can be really funny, and one of my favorite things is creating humor and making people laugh. My hope is that this doc will do some of that.
