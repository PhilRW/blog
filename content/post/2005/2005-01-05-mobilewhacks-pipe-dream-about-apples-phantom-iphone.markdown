For the past few days now I’ve been scouring the net for something like this phone. It doesn’t exist. It won’t exist for a long time. Apple and cell phones? Well, it would have to be a GSM phone. What about EDGE? By the time that happens, Cingular will have rolled out its nationwide UMTS network and the phone will need “updating” ($$$). But wait, isn’t that how this technology game is _supposed_ to work?

I don’t know. All I know is I need a new cell phone and Steve may pull a rabbit out of his hat at MWSF 2005, but he might not. Things are good, and they’re only getting better. We must look to the future but relish what we have in the present because there’s always something better on the horizon.

What I really think for the near-term future is that Motorola and Apple will work together on a phone or two. I suspect the V635 will have a mobile version of iTunes on it. Hopefully Apple will update its iSync software with Tiger supporting oodles of more phones. Then us happy GSM subscribers will pick and choose what device to converge with our digital lives. My T637 is good and all, but I want a phone I can read outdoors. :stuck_out_tongue:
