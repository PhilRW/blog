I'm still lacking on the external oppositional force. I simply must pursue this Hummer driver avenue and see where it takes me. I believe the environment-trashing H driver may have been a stereotype, but also may have been an optimistic one. I would love to explore the character of someone like that and attempt to reconcile his viewpoint, but as discussed in class, a more human rationale is bound to come forth. 

I'm seeing more of a development of a "movement" for biodiesel homebrewing. There is a great demand for information on and supply of biodiesel, but for some reason there is no general public awareness of the topic. I'm thinking I should explore that. Is there possibly some force at work to actively prevent the information from being disseminated or is it simply a lack of interest on the part of the mass media? I should also examine how people get their information and whether they seek it out or it comes to them.

Some of my contacts are also seeking me out, which I find encouraging. I think this indicates not only a willingness to participate but some measure of success on my part.
