Well I’m directing a 546 Doc in the fall. My immediate task is to crew up. Then keep it alive over the summer. Oh yeah, I should finish out this semester, too. Then over the summer I need to look for a place to live for the fall. Anyone know of any good places in LA? It’s warming up, too, so I should probably install air conditioning in my apartment for the summer. Then I need to do the whole FAFSA/financial aid thing, and the paperwork for the graduation ceremony next month.

But other than that, not much is happening. :stuck_out_tongue:
