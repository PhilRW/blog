I had some interesting thoughts about my initial project idea and documentaries/video in general this week. They're more questions than answers and more fragmented wonderings than cohesive ideas, but I'll give a shot at bringing them together.

From the basic alternative fuel vehicles I can narrow dwn to diesel/hybrid cars. Diesel cars that run on grease? Diesel vs. gasoline? Global/diesel (fewer greenhouse gasses, more smog-forming particulates) vs. local/gasoline (less smog, more accessible fueling, more PC). Why do Europeans get so many diesel cars and here in the US our choices are so limited? What is the mindset? Who is right or why is it different?

The ethics of choosing your ride? Are people more globally conscious who buy fuel-efficient cars or are they just falling in line with the media hype machine? Is it hype? I know a person who doesn't believe that the world will run out of crude oil ever; it could be interesting to interview him for his viewpoint on the matter. Of course, he's not very environmentally conscious. But I don't want to make a value judgment on environmentalism -- I want it to be obvious from the facts.

Anyway, these are a lot of questions, which I suppose is good at this point. It could be interesting to pit a 42-mpg diesel against a less-than-10 mpg gas powered Hummer or something of that nature (just the image of a Hummer trampling over plant life as it cuts a gasoline-powered swath through nature could be very compelling). What are the political implications / ramifications of driving what we drive and how does the auto industry influence the government or vice versa? What is the government/private sector doing to research and promote alternative, RENEWABLE fuels/sources of energy? -- NREL in Boulder could be a place to start.

An interesting way to approach this documentary could be through those people who have already taken it upon themselves to integrate renewable energy into their lifestyles. The philosophy of zero-impact on the planet -- is it feasible? Now? Why aren't we doing it now? Money/economics? Greed? Corruption? (large issues to tackle). 

I could see how much crude oil it takes to make a gallon of gasoline vs. a gallon of diesel and where that crude oil comes from. (Middle East tie-in?)

How is it that people can make biodiesel (diesel fuel from renewable carbon-neutral sources instead of dino-crude) at home in 55 gal. drums but you can't get it at the pump? Would it really be that much more expensive? At what point does the price increase become too much of a burden ? (Economy vs. Ecology) -- I think that is at the core of some of my issues.

How about used waste fryer oil -- people taking it for free from restaurants (which they have to pay to remove anyway: classified as hazardous waste) and turning that into biodiesel or running it straight from an aux. tank. Who wouldn't jump at the chance for free fuel in his car? Risk analysis? Success stories? Problems with doing it this way? (See German company -- forget name at the moment -- they've done single-tank conversions.)

Another theme/thought I had: media vs. reality -- where do we get our info (See: Noam Chomsky and the Media). The internet as a conglomerate-free means of spreading information. 

Another thought I had unrelated to my project was as I was reading Rabiger and he explained direct cinema vs cin�ma v�rit�: If someone were to take a group of cameras in a cluster onto a sidewalk and roll tape and just wait for a crowd to form, how long would it take? What would happen? Is this cinema v�rit� taken to the extreme? Would the local news get involved? Would anyone care?

Interesting -- as I review this entry, my spellchecker doesn't have "biodiesel" in its vocabulary: it's giving it a red squiggly underline.
