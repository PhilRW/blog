So it’s been a while since I’ve posted. I’ve been working on this little half-hour documentary now called _Fueling Change_. It briefly explores three fossil fuel alternatives: biodiesel, vegetable oil, and electric vehicles, and the people who use them. The premiere screening, along with the other two docs in the class, is on USC campus in the Norris Cinema Theater on December 10, 2005, at 7:30 pm.
