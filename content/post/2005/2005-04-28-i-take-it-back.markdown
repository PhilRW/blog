My neighbor isn’t an inconsiderate prick any more. I e-mailed him and asked him to stop the loud music in the morning and he apologized. Now to find the people who built the place and find out why they didn’t put insulation in the walls. Oh, okay. It’s Los Angeles, that’s why. I have a theory that if it ever stayed below freezing in LA for any period of time that everything would fall apart and there would be chaos everywhere. That probably goes true for lots of mediterranian-climate-type places.
