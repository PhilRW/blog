Hmm. This weekend was a bit different. I went over to the Los Angeles EcoVillage -- not knowing what to expect -- and find a wonderful community of people living lightly on the earth. There is conflict and drama in the group, especially since they all have to reach consensus on the day's activities. I made some more contacts, and that helps me feel more at ease with where I'm going with the project. Since then I have been trying to get in touch with one of them for an interview this week with little success. It seems he's never home. This does not put me at ease. I could always interview the random passer-by on the street, but that's not where I see this project headed. And I believe that is my weakest area, "getting out of the car." Despite my earlier apparent success with encountering actual people, I'm not great at making the phone call. I also feel that I have had a very limited amount of time with which to build trust with a few potential subjects. I can continue to build this trust over the summer but for now it's moving fast. I do appreciate Rabiger's suggestion to avoid any deep topics in the initial video pre-interview, which is how I view these. 

I'm also wondering what kind of oppositional force I can portray in the film. I'm weary of picking a group such as a Los Angeles area Hummer owner's club. I'm sure I can portray them in a fair and sane light without undue bias, but I wonder if I'm picking them just as a foil to my eco-nuts or if I really want to know their positions and what they want to say. I don't want to pull a Michael Moore. :) His style of filmmaking doesn't appeal to me from an ethical standpoint.
