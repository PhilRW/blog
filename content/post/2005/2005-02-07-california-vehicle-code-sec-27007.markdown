No driver of a vehicle shall operate, or permit the operation of, any
sound amplification system which can be heard outside the vehicle from
50 or more feet when the vehicle is being operated upon a highway,
unless that system is being operated to request assistance or warn of a
hazardous situation. This section shall not apply to authorized
emergency vehicles or vehicles operated by gas, electric,
communications, or water utilities. This section does not apply to the
sound systems of vehicles used for advertising, or in parades, political
or other special events, except that use of sound systems on those
vehicles may be prohibited by a local authority by ordinance or
resolution.
