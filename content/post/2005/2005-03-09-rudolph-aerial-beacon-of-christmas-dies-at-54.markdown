**read this aloud as a newscaster:** Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer died yesterday, he was 54. He was flying over Barcelona when his flight path crossed crossed with that of a large flock of seagulls... and a Boeing 747. Although authorities are still investigating the cause of the crash, witnesses at the scene say the reindeer in Spain was hit mainly by the plane.
