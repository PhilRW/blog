That _Two and a Half Men_ episode I saw taped back in on Dec. 3 finally aired tonight on CBS. Interesting choices. I didn’t much care for the show when it was taped, and I still think the writing could use improvement, but editing and post definitely helped the episode, and Charlie Sheen is much better on camera than he is live (hate to say it, but it’s true, at least from far away). I can make out Nikki’s laugh in the right channel of the audience laugh track, it’s quite discernable at times.
