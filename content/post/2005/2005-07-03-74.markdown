You could hear the distant crack of the explosives echoing off the brick facade of the neighborhood. The distinctive whirr and pop of the ammunition. Sometimes a barrage would go off all at once and dogs would bark in the distance. There were loud explosions all over the sky, they would light up the city in a brief flash of light. It was dangerous to fly low in this environment. Even driving a personnel transport down the street you risked being hit by it or at least driving over some of the spent casings. The stacatto noises filled the night sky. Only the profiteers who made the explosives were sleeping soundly tonight.

Happy 4th of July everybody!
