Sometimes I wonder if people even listen to the outgoing message on my phone at all. My name is not Jeremiah so your urgent message to him will go unanswered. Golly, I hope Jeremiah doesn’t get fired because his boss dialed the wrong number and left a message for someone whose name CLEARLY ISN’T JEREMIAH. What good is an outgoing message if NOBODY LISTENS?!
