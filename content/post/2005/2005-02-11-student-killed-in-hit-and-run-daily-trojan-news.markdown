This was a student from my building. I didn’t know him, but apparently he was a doctoral business student in his last year.

Please, people, please be careful when crossing the street. It’s not your fault, but just be safe! Look both ways and never assume any crazy, inconsiderate, hit-and-run coward will _ever_ stop for you.

Above: Just slightly below and left of center is the sheet covering the victim’s body. This was about 25-50 yards from the front door to my apartment. The crosswalk where he was allegedly hit was much further down the street.
