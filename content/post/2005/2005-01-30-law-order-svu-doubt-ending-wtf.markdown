This was a balanced he said/she said case of rape and the last words in the episode were: (Foreman) “We the jury find the defendant...” then dissolve to black and bring up the credits. WTF?! Those GD SOB’s who make that show! (Please excuse my language.) Yo boneheads: if you were trying to piss off their your viewers, congratulations, you succeeded! Don’t toy with the television experience, or I’ll seriously mess you up! GRRRRRRRRR! Anyone else see this episode? Did you enjoy the “verdict?” It’s not even like it said “To Be Continued” or anything like that. It just ended. Are we supposed to make up our own verdict? Is this some kind of sick audience participation thing? Well the _viewer_ was raped in this episode. Or was he? I don’t know. You decide. ...Yeah.

It’s not like I was paying much attention to the show anyway. It was on in the background. But whodunit?
