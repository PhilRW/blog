This cracked me up. If you don’t know _Whose Line...?_, watch it.

(order: Wayne, Chip, Colin, Ryan; subject: something that could go bad on a date—falling out of the car) Now, you have to sing this as you read it, or it won’t be as much fun.

Oh, Heidi-didi-didi-didi, didi-didi-di

My date and I were drivin’  
I’m lucky to be alive  
We were goin over 60  
It wasn’t my kind of jive  
Then my door opened  
It could not be beat  
I fell right out  
...Boy, that was neat

Oh, Heidi-didi-didi-didi, didi-didi-di

She rolled out on the pavement  
She didn’t have on her belt  
She screamed at me as I took off  
“Damn, that was hard, it felt”  
I cried until I s-saw her  
Then I stopped again  
I turned the car around  
And drove and picked up her best friend

Oh, Heidi-didi-didi-didi, didi-didi-di

I had to go for help  
I ran and ran and ran  
I ran a little more  
Until I saw this man  
I said, “Can you help me?”  
He looked at me and said no  
I had to hit him  
Your girl is on their dough

Oh, Heidi-didi-didi-didi, didi-didi-di

Oh, finally she forgave me  
Now we’re married  
She can almost walk now  
Boy, we are not harried  
This is a day we’ll never forget  
We will not  
And every night we drive  
_She has gravel in her snot_

Oh, Heidi-didi-didi-didi, didi-didi-di  
Oh, Heidi-didi-didi-didi, didi-didi-di

(They almost couldn’t keep it together on Colin’s last line.)
