Do people love being in love or are people just in love with the _idea_ of being in love? Do you remember being in love? Do you remember falling out of love? Do you remember that stasis between the two? Which do you prefer?

What does intimacy mean? Why have I not found someone? Have I been looking? Have I missed her? Is she right under my nose? Is that my upper lip?

Why does sex sell? What’s wrong with the media? What’s right with the media? Why so many questions?

What is happiness? How do I achieve it? What do I need to be happy? What do I not need? What do I want? What do I do to get what I want? Is that working? Should I do something else? What should I do differently? How do my needs differ from my wants? Where is the disconnect?

Will I think of any better questions? Will you ask yourself these questions? Will you answer them? Will _I_ answer them? Do you even care? Has this been too much for one entry?

Are you out there?
