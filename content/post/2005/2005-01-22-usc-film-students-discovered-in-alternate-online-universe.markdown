I found the [website](http://www.aliceandkevin.com/) of fellow film student Kevin and his wife Alice. It’s a little out-of-date but stays current with new posts, almost exclusively from Alice. I have playfully chastised Kevin for neglecting to post an update in a year and a half. Then if everyone gets a blog we can just all read each other’s websites and stay up to date without ever actually having to talk to one another. Kinda like what I’m doing right now. Sheesh.

Does anyone even read this shilznit anyway? I’ll take “[0] comments” as a “no.”
