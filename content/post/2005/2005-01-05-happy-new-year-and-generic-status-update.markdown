So I figure I’d better post an update in here lest someone actually
read this blog. Went to Indiana (Elkhart) for X-mas, saw family, ate a
lot, gained a pound or two. Came back. It’s snowing now in Denver. I’m
heading back to L.A. before too long. Probably on Saturday or whenever
this storm passes. It’s late now so I’m going to bed. A whole lot of
sleepin’ to do.
