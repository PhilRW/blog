I've made a few 3D printed things recently, and I thought I'd share.

## Vent Tube Cap

I was looking for a vent tube cap for 4" schedule 40 PVC, and I couldn't find exactly what I was looking for, so I made one. This will go underground and drain into some gravel in case there is condensation or other moisture in some vertical ventilation tubes.

This took almost no time at all to model in software and only about 6 hours to print. I made a second revision that is much shorter beacuse I didn't have enough clearance for the initial version, since the pipes are already installed.

## House Model

The next item is a 3D model of our house. This took a solid day to draw in software and another day to refine. I printed it at 1/8" = 1' scale so I could use my drafting ruler. The family proceeded to make small paper figures to inhabit the model.
