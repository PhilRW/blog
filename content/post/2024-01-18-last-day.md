To my friends and former colleagues:
<!--more-->
I write you this letter searching for a sense of closure, that human connection that the cold corporate hand has so cruelly and abruptly denied us. I wish to thank you all for spending the last thirteen years of my life with me, comrades through it all. For those of you who remain, I wish you all the best in strength and fortitude to carry on, for I know it will be hard, nigh impossible, to continue without me (ha ha). Please keep in touch with me; you will find my name and contact information on the internet with little difficulty. I do sincerely mean it when I say that you all were a great part of my life and will all be sorely missed. And if you have read the books to which I am about to refer (and if you have not, it's high time you had), please take my whole meaning when I say, "so long, and thanks for all the fish."

Yours sincerely ever,

Phil Rosenberg-Watt
