My home internet has been pretty crappy for the past couple of weeks now. It is so bad that I set up a [SmokePing](https://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping/) server to quantify my misery, as I have a Modem of Constant Sorrow that won't stay online for more than a day or so without rebooting.

We've replaced the CM and checked the interior wiring.

What IÂ _really_ want is Gigabit Pro (fiber) service to my house, but apparently Comcast can't or won't run it the _tremendous_ distance the nearest fiber is from my house: a whole **two (2) poles away**, _right next to_ my nearest amp. :(
