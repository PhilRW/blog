It really sucks when you have nobody call you all day to check up on you or to ask how your day went.

It really sucks when you have no one to call and talk to when your day is done, nobody to be accountable to, no one to listen to.

Today was a long day. After I drove through the rain to get to work this morning, listening to Billy Joel's _Innocent Man_, and watching a fantastic double rainbow appear and vanish, I remembered a poem I learned from my youth:

> The day is cold, and dark, and dreary;  
> It rains, and the wind is never weary;  
> The vine still clings to the mouldering wall,  
> But at every gust the dead leaves fall,  
> And the day is dark and dreary.  

> My life is cold, and dark, and dreary;  
> It rains, and the wind is never weary;  
> My thoughts still cling to the mouldering past,  
> But the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast,  
> And the days are dark and dreary.  

> Be still, sad heart, and cease repining;  
> Behind the clouds is the sun still shining;  
> Thy fate is the common fate of all,  
> Into each life some rain must fall,  
> Some days must be dark and dreary.w

> <cite>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</cite>
