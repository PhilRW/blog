I'm thankful, too.

Some things I was thankful for 365 days ago I no longer have. Some things I wanted 365 days ago I now have.

Traditionally we go around and list those items for which we're thankful, but skipping one that is not on the list this time around only draws attention to it, at least in my mind. It'll be that way this whole season, unfortunately.

So thanks for those things I still have. And thanks for those things that I once had that are now elsewhere. At least I got to experience them for a brief time.
