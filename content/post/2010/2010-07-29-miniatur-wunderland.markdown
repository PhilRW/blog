There's a model railroading convention in Denver right now and this got me thinking, "what's the largest and most impressive model railroad I can find?" It's called the Miniatur Wunderland and it's in Germany, of course.

I'm totally going to go here. It looks like I could easily spend an entire day here. This is now officially on my list of places to see.
