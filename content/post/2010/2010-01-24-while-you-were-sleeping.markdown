Hey babe,

I'm writing you this email, well, mostly just to get my feelings off my chest. I don't do well keeping things pent-up inside so I guess I'll feel better if I put them into words.

I don't know why you get upset like this. I don't believe I have done anything wrong, and really I have no reason to feel bad for anything. If there's something I can do better for you then I'd be happy to try, but if you refuse to communicate that to me then there's nothing more I can do. I can't force you to communicate with me.

I've noticed that this tends to happen every so often: you get in a bad mood for some reason or another. Sometimes I feel up to coaxing the "why" out of you, but sometimes I don't. Let me relate my feelings on this.

I'm feeling a mix of things as I write this that I'm sure will pass by the time you read this. But let me put them into words just so I can get them out. When you behave in this way towards me, I feel manipulated, angry, and upset. I feel shamed, as if I've done something wrong, even though I haven't. So sometimes I try to get you to talk about it, even though that's not really my "job," and other times I simply let it go... I take a deep breath and set it aside.

Let me tell you what I believe part of being a healthy, grown up adult is about. It's about not playing games. It's about not expecting the other person to read your mind. It's about behaving rationally -- but still having the freedom to let go emotionally, just so long as that emotional release is not "blamed" on the other person. It's about taking responsibility for one's own feelings and state of mind and realizing that the only person who is in control of what you feel is you. Nobody can make you feel a particular way, we can only choose to react in a particular way. And it is a choice: how we deal with what we are given is a choice. So when you say, "I'm mad at you," I take it on face value. What you choose to do with that emotion is entirely up to you and I read nothing more into it, because to do so would be to assign it an implied context (a.k.a. *assume*), which as we all know makes an ass out of u and me. See? I'm indifferent because I care. I care about solid communication skills and the longer-term affect on our relationship. I will not be shamed into feeling bad for no reason, but if there is a misunderstanding from a miscommunication, then we need to fix the problem or deal with it sooner. This is why I ask you why you are upset.

Hmm. It just occurred to me that you may not even know why you are upset at me. Hmm. Very interesting. If that is the case then I may need to reexamine my whole perspective. Ding! Epiphany. Anyway, moving on...

I also feel angry because I don't want to put up with any of this "you should sleep on the couch" bullshit -- even though you probably wouldn't say it out loud. It's meaningless and hurtful. I was going to write that it serves no purpose, but "cooling off" is a purpose, just so long as it is framed properly. I don't do well living in a state of conflict. I do better with harmony. And behaving in a particular way is fine for the rest of society, but these are *our lives* we're dealing with, here. I refuse to behave in a certain way just because you may believe other people do so and therefore it's a social norm. We can choose to make our lives whatever the hell we want to, and one thing I firmly believe (probably because it's catchy and an old person said it to me once) is to never go to bed angry. Why waste all that effort on stuff so meaningless?

So I'm not going to talk about pro life/pro choice, or whatever instigated this particular incident. It's immeterial. THIS IS NOT BECAUSE I DO NOT CARE OR AM INDIFFERENT. It's because I'm going to fight like hell to make this relationship better, to lift us up out of any sort of dysfunctional, passive-aggressive, codependent patterns either of us may have brought with us from our past and/or upbringings. We deserve to be the best couple we can be, if not for us then for the rest of the world. We owe it to coupledom. In my mind there is always room for improvement: everywhere and with everything. Those improvements may be small and that doesn't mean that what we have already isn't great (there I go again with those double negatives). I just want to make it better, smoother, easier, more effective, and now with 30% less fat!

Ok, now I'll read this email over and decide whether or not to actually send it.

By the way, if I did anything to offend you or upset you, previously or now or in the future, then I'm sorry and I apologize.

I love you my love,

-Phil

P.S. I only re-read this email 6 times this time. :)
