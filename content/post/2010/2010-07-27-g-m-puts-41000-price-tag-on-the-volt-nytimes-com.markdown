Hmm. Let me think about this for a minute. $32780 for a fully electric vehicle (Nissan LEAF) with minimal maintenance **or** I could spend $8220 more for a vehicle that _still_ uses gasoline (premium, nonetheless) and has 2/5 the pure-electric range. Sorry, Chevy. I think you missed the boat again.

If I want a long-range petroleum-powered car, I'll drive my Golf. If I want to stay in town, I'll go with a pure EV. Simple. Get off the petro!
