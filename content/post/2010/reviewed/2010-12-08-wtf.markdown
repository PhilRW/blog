Who or What can be the first word in that acronym. I came home late today after my DAREC meeting and my sister and mom were decorating the tree, as planned, but some guy was hanging out with Rachel, sipping on a beer. J-something. Justin, Jason, Jeremy, maybe? Anyway... WTF?!

I'm not better. I'm not even close to better. I'm busier, but all that does is distract myself from the pain and loneliness. It's less intense but still persistent. And to see Rachel with a guy when she broke up about the same time that I did? From a relationship that lasted about as long? WTF?

Life is hard enough as it is right now.
