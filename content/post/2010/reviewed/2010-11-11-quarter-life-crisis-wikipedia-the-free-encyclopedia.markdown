I'm wondering lately if some of my friends aren't going through a late-twenties quarterlife crisis. My life has changed dramatically in the months surrounding my 30th birthday. While I feel as though I've made it through the worst of it, there are certainly some items from the article that ring true either to me personally or based on observations I've made of others:<!--more-->

* confronting their own [mortality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality)

* watching time slowly take its toll on their parents, only to realize they are next

* insecurity concerning ability to love themselves, let alone another person

* re-evaluation of close [interpersonal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal) relationships

* lack of friendships or romantic relationships, [sexual frustration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_frustration), and [involuntary celibacy](http://web.archive.org/web/20131214044229/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_celibacy)

* disappointment with one's job

* nostalgia for [university](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University), [college](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College), [high school](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school), [middle school](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school) or [elementary school](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_school) life

* financially-rooted stress (overwhelming [college loans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_loan), unanticipatedly high [cost of living](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living), etc.)

* [loneliness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loneliness), [depression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)) and [suicidal tendencies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide)

* desire to have children

* a sense that everyone is, somehow, doing better than oneself
