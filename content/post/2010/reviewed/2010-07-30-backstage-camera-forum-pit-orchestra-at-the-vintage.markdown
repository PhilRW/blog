This is a live an image of the pit orchestra at the Vintage Theater's production of _A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum_. I'm the musical director and I play the keyboard closest to the camera. We run weekends until August 8 and we still have some tickets left. [Buy your tickets now](http://www.vintagetheatre.com/) before we're completely sold out.
