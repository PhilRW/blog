Today after class one of my students asked if I was teaching Production III next semester, because “[he’d] take from [me] again in a heartbeat.” Another student in my class, his friend, agreed.

Don’t that just make ya feel good? Thanks, guys.  :)

That kinda balances out the statement from earlier this semester by a student in my other class that mine was “the worst production class [he’d] ever taken.” This statement was also said to me in front of at least one other student in the same class, yet somehow didn’t have the same heartwarming effect. Go figure.
