Alone again I am in my heart. I will miss the warmth of her touch, her smile, her laugh. So many little things that I cannot describe them all in great enough detail here or ever with words. She understood me on a level that few others ever have or ever will. And forever to me will that single capital letter K spell out so much more in my heart that I deign not to use it otherwise.

How many tears are enough? How much sorrow is enough?

I have no answers.
