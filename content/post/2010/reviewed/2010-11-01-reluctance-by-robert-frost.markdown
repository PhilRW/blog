> Out through the fields and the woods  
> And over the walls I have wended;  
> I have climbed the hills of view  
> And looked at the world, and descended;  
> I have come by the highway home,  
> And lo, it is ended.

> The leaves are all dead on the ground,  
> Save those that the oak is keeping  
> To ravel them one by one  
> And let them go scraping and creeping  
> Out over the crusted snow,  
> When others are sleeping.

> And the dead leaves lie huddled and still,  
> No longer blown hither and thither;  
> The last lone aster is gone;  
> The flowers of the witch-hazel wither;  
> The heart is still aching to seek,  
> But the feet question 'Whither?'

> Ah, when to the heart of man  
> Was it ever less than a treason  
> To go with the drift of things,  
> To yield with a grace to reason,  
> And bow and accept the end  
> Of a love or a season?
>
