title: I Am Not...
wordpress_id: 2800

I am not disposable.

I am not an accessory.

I cannot be tucked away when I don't "go" with the outfit du jour.

I cannot be stored out of sight when I am not wanted.

My purpose is not to make you look good.

My purpose is not to make you feel good about yourself.

I cannot be walked all over, nor can I be used to walk over others.

I cannot get you where you need to go.

I am not fashionable, nor do I ever go out of style.

I am not whatever you need me to be.


I am not a shoe.
