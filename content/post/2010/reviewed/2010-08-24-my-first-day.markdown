Today was my first day at work. I met with legal, HR, IT, and Facilities. I got a desk (in the lab), laptop computer with external dock+monitor+mouse+keyboard, a phone, a phone number, an email address, a network login & password, and more info than I can remember.<!--more--> Tomorrow I'm scheduled to meet with the Library, Accounting, and Communications. Busy c0uple of orientation days!

I'm a bit overwhelmed, but in a good way. So far they seem smart, easy-going, and casual yet formal when necessary. I like my manager and pretty much everyone I've met. Plus, I already knew two of the employees (in other departments) through extracurricular (musical) activities!

I'm going to soak in some more of the benefits information. I'll eventually want to read the benefits and employee manuals. One benefit - a Sam's Club or Costco membership is reimbursed up to $45.
