Wilder & Wilder played at the [Montreal Improv Festival](http://www.montrealimprovfestival.com) this year. Steve brought me along as the accompanist. We left Denver on Thursday at 4pm and arrived in Motreal at 2am via Detroit (30 minute connection - literally ran across the airport), Burlington, and a rental car. Coming back we left at 3am and arrived in Denver around 12:30.<!--more-->

Montreal is a neat place. Friday was cold and rainy, but Saturday was cool and sunny. The people were always warm and smiley, at least those hosting the festival.

Here are some pics I took. I stayed at the [Bienvenue Bed & Breakfast](http://www.bienvenuebb.com), 4 blocks from the theater.
