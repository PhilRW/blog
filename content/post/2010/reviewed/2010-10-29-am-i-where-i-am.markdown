```
Life is tough where I am now.
Nobody calls, the phone sits still.
    
I pretend to go about business
To which I sentenced myself long ago.
    
But I want to sleep
And cry.
    
No one can touch my heart,
It is cold and aches
When others approach.
    
Still sits the phone, calls nobody.
Now am I where tough is life.
```
