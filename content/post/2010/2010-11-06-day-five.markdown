There is nothing new to report. The winds may be abating slightly, but there is little by way of metrics or instruments to measure them. The climate may be softening as well, or I may merely be adapting. Time will tell. Occasionally there is a fierce burst of wind that jolts and jostles the crate. Were I not somewhat protected within its confines surely I would be knocked over by these sudden gusts.
