I remember this from my dream this morning: I dreamed that K gave me a card with money paperclipped to the inside top of the card. Folded together in this order were three bills: $1, $1000, and $20. Then she embraced me and we kissed, but I wasn't into it. I got the sense that her father was in the background somewhere but he wasn't physically there.

Does this mean that she's going to try to bribe her way back into my life? What is the significance of the numbers? I remember feeling that $1000 was a lot butÂ  not enough to take her back.
