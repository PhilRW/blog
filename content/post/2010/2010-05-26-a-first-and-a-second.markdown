Two in the same day. Thatâ€™s a first for me.

This one at 7:18 am:


<blockquote>Thank you for expressing an interest in the Assoc Engr position. While it is never an easy decision, we have decided to consider other candidates whose qualifications more closely matched the needs of this position.</blockquote>


...and this one at 7:26 pm:


<blockquote>We want to thank you for your interest in the position of Audio Visual Coordinator 00874 advertised April 5, 2010 through April 16, 2010 11:59 PM. Unfortunately, you have not been chosen to advance to the next step in the selection process and at this time will not be under further consideration for this position.</blockquote>
