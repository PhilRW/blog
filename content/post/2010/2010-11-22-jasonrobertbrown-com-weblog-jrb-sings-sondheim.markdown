How cool is this? I just had to post this for all my musican/musical theater people. He posted a PDF and recording of his arrangement of "Sunday" for Sondheim's 80th birthday celebration. I'm at work as I write this so I haven't listened to it yet, but I will soon.

P.S. I think maybe he needs to get his blog to show the title of the post in the title of the webpage, no? (When folks link to it it may help distinguish.)
