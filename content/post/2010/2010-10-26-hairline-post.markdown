In typing my last blog entry I realized that _elation_ is a big part of the word _relationship._

But, then again, if you rearrange the letters you can also get _hailstone_, _antihero_, _hernia_, _hospital_, _loathe_, _ethanol_, _sharpen_, _a-hole_, and _rip into_, so maybe that doesn't mean so much after all.

:P
