<blockquote>According to a report by the Aviation Safety Network, which keeps a database of aircraft incidents and accidents, Flight 32 suffered an “uncontained” engine failure six minutes after take-off from Singapore, which it said caused “substantial” damage to the plane. An uncontained engine failure is an extremely rare type of incident where components detach and fly off the main engine housing — often with explosive force.</blockquote>
