I discovered two things about a couple of JRB's songs today in the car:



	
  1. Enroute to work, I noticed the lyrics "major, minor, or modal" have accompanying and accurate piano chords in _I'mÂ In Bizness_. This was on my 4th listen to the song.

	
  2. I got the meaning of_ Over_ on the way home. This was the 11th time I'd listened to the song.


I should note that I was not necessarily focusing on listening to the songs: I just had spontaneous discovery moments. But it does take me a while sometimes.
