My dearest Kelly,

Here's the record of events, just in case somehow you didn't remember:

1. You had some drinks at the Rock Bottom Brewery, so much so that you almost fell down a few times on the way to my car.
2. You cried (sobbed, really) for a few minutes then passed out in my car.
3. At some point during the ride you threw up a little bit, some of it on my rear seat, most of it on your jacket.
4. I had to carry you to your apartment doorstep where I needed to set you down in order to open the door to your apartment, but as I was about to set you down you started to vomit (again) in my arms, so I placed you as gingerly as possible on the ground on your side in the "recovery position" (after being exhausted carrying that keyboard up and down the stairs and playing all night for 4 hours) so you could finish your emesis of most of what you ate tonight wi(hmm... pasta of some kind?).
5. I propped open the screen door part-way and literally had to drag you into the entryway into your apartment.
6. I took Annie out, who licked your face on her way outside. She only did a #1.
7. While you were unconscious on the floor I put the blanket on the couch and cleaned up the small amount of semidigested dinner in the back seat of my car.
8. Then I came back in and with what last strength I could muster I placed you on the couch. A few minutes later you upchucked the last bits of what used to the be contents of your stomach.
9. I watched you on the couch for a little while to make sure that you were okay and not choking/drowning on anything, and wiped off what little I could reach. At this point I really want to clean up you and the couch but I have very little strength left in my arms. It's true what they say: a totally limp human (dead weight) is a lot heavier and a lot harder to carry than the same person who's conscious.
10. Annie had her dinner as normal, now that we were both here. :) She also licked up some spillage in the entryway.
11. I think I'm going to try cleaning up some of you and the couch -- It's probably seeped through the blanket into the couch by now but I have so little strength left to move you with.
12. Okay, I cleaned up most of the solid and liquid and made sure you stayed on your side with your head down and mouth facing downward.
13. Thank God you're okay. Messy, but okay.

Now my feelings. I'm a little angry that the night had to end like this. I'm really pissed at your so-called "friends" who let you -- nay, encouraged you to -- get this fucked up. Who was the one who was telling you to finish off that beer before you left Rock Bottom? Screw her and screw them. REAL friends don't put their friends through this shit. Or, more specifically, their friend's devoted boyfriend through this shit cause you were unconscious for the worst of it.

I seriously thought about diverting to the nearest hospital because I didn't know how bad you were, and you deteriorated very rapidly.

I'm also feeling really kinda sad. I had this really awesome day planned for us tomorrow but now I'm pretty sure that's not going to happen. Probably not even half of it, if that. I was going to go home after the show and unload gear while you snoozed in my car and sneakily sneak the stuff I bought for you today into the back while you weren't looking (or while you were sleeping). Then we'd get up leisurely around 10 or so and I'd have brought in the stuff I got for you. Instead, now I have to sit here watching you 'cause I'm worried you might roll off the couch. My keyboard is still in my car and your birthday items are still at my house.

I'm glad this is not a regular occurance. Please don't let this happen that often (or ever again). It kinda ruined my night. But I learned some stuff. For one, I didn't know that people could puke when unconscious. And also -- all that good food and drink came back up! What a waste of money! That is not consistent with living frugally. I say if you buy it, you should at least absorb the calories. Otherwise it just raises the CPC (cost per calorie) of your diet, and that's no bueno 'cause everything's more expensive now. :)

So sleep, my love. You'll sleep for a long time and when you wake up you'll probably have a pretty bad hangover for most of the day and me somewhat surprised with the dried vomit on your clothes, in your hair, and on your couch.

Love you,

-Phil

P.S. Now that I'm reading about alcohol intoxication, I'm getting more upset. You're BAC was probably somewhere between 0.25-0.4 (stupor) or 0.35-0.5 (coma). Any much more = death. Too much drinking can kill you. Seriously. I don't want you to die. Stay alive, dammit! Truth be told, had I mishandled you, you probably could have choked on your own vomit and died tonight. :(...
