I really needed this today. It had me laughing so hard I was crying. First I watched the Beatles number, which warmed me up, and then I watched the Queen number. By the time Freddie Mercury started coughing/hacking/wheezing/sneezing at the keyboard, I totally lost it. Tears down my cheeks from the laughter.
