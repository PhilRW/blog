It’s been a while since I’ve posted an update. The Southern California October 2003 Wildfires have come and gone, the weather has turned colder, and _Streakers_ has gone from production into post-production. I will most likely not have time to post another update for quite a while, and I apologize if this one isn’t quite really up to snuff. I’m doing my best, but this blog thing is really last on my priority list.

And that’s pretty much it. Sorry to disappoint. I’ll see you in December, perhaps?
