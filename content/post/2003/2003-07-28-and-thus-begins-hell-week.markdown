So I’ve been doing this play over at Englewood, _Bye Bye Birdie_, and I’m playing Conrad. Anyway, this week is dress rehearsal week as we perform on August 1st, 2nd (my birthday), and 3rd. Tonight is the first dress rehearsal. We add costumes, makeup, lights, orchestra, and scene changes into the mix tonight. Wednesday we add makeup and push back the call by one hour. Should be fun...!
