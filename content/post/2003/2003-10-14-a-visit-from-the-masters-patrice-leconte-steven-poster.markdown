Jeremy Kagan arranged for French director Patrice Leconte to talk to us about some of his filmmaking experiences. He was joined later by American cinematographer Steven Poster and the two of them related their experiences working together as it pertains to a learning experience for the student directors. It was very interesting. These two film giants have worked so much in the industry and have so much experience; it was inspiring, a little humbling, exciting, and very informative.
