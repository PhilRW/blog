It’s funny, but whenever my classmates and I get together before a
class we never really talk about current events. A category 5 hurricane
is about to slam into the East coast, the October 7 gubernatorial recall
election has been put on hold, and all we talk about is filmmaking.
This seems to be a recurring issue with me—how focused we are in our own
little worlds and really how insignificant all those petty little
things seem when compared to the larger picture. Then again, it’s always
nice to have a passion.
