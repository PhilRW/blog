I’m finally thinking about starting to get ready to go back to school. I have a lot of packing to do. I think I’ll make it a three-day drive, as I did this last Winter break, and go back to LA via Albuquerque and Chino Valley, AZ. I conveniently have family in both cities which splits the drive up into three 7-hour days instead of two longer days if driven via Utah and Nevada. If I get my digital camera back/replaced in time for the trip (I better, dammit), then I’ll take lots of pictures enroute. Northern Arizona is quite scenic; at least the Western half of it is.
