I was just interviewed on camera by Jeremy Jojola for a [channel 9 news ](http://www.9news.com)consumer story on dashcams. Jeremy says that [my footage](https://blog.rosenberg-watt.com/2015/03/17/bringing-you-all-the-greatest-hits/) was useful in a police investigation, and it was quite possibly the first case in Denver where dashcam footage was instrumental.

The segment will air sometime in May. The whole interview took about 20 minutes. TV news crews are apparently quite efficient with their time.
