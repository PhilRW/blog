Okay, folks, here's what it boils down to (pun intended): the next few decades will see more intense and frequent droughts, flooding, crop failures, food insecurity, mass migrations (Europe's current refugee "crisis" is mild by comparison), severe weather, and conflicts over ever-dwindling natural resources as our home planet's climate change forcibly changes our behaviors. Humans generally suck at nonviolent conflict resolution, so there will probably be much violence. The world will be divided between the nations as "haves" and "have-nots" even more so than today as our humanitarian relief effort resources are reallocated to deal with domestic crises. There is no avoiding it at this point, so let's just accept it and try not to _completely _annihilate each other in the process, okay?
