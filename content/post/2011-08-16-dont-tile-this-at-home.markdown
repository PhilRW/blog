title: Don't Tile This At Home
wordpress_id: 3464
---

I'm installing tile floor in my kitchen. After weeks and weeks of removing things from the floors and walls, it's nice to be putting something back into my house. There is nobody here to help me this week: I'm doing the tile all by myself. The helper in the 1st picture is there for moral support as she lacks opposable thumbs.
