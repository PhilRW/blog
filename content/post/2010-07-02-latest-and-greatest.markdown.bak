This time I can’t post the text of the job rejection because it was done over the phone. Over the past two two weeks I got through an initial phone screen, hour-long technical phone interview, hour-long in-person technical interview by two techs and a 30-45 minute in-person interview by a manager. Then they called and left a message to call them back for “feedback” on the interview. My recruiter said that the technical interviews and such went fine but that they were looking for someone with more Windows experience so they were no longer going to pursue this opportuinty. She said maybe at the end of Q4 there would be more job openings.

There’s no smiley face for sobbing your heart out, so I’ll omit the emoticon.
