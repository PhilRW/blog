title: Why SNL's Sound of Music Cold Open Wasn't Funny

It's simple, even though I only watched the first few minutes of it. (That's almost as little as what I could stand to watch of the Sound of Music broadcast itself, but I digress....) SNL's cold open wasn't funny because it didn't make fun of the Sound of Music live broadcast. I don't watch SNL, so I don't get their in-jokes. I had no idea who that creepy awkward character was, nor did I care. The SoM broadcast provided ample opportunity for parody, but they didn't even acknowledge its awfulness in the little I watched. Did it get better? Or more relevant?

I guess you have to be good _first,_ before you can be intentionally bad. SNL was merely _cheap_, capitalizing on the hype surrounding SoM without acknowledging that they actually watched it. (Did they?)

Where is Aaron Sorkin when you need him? Or Gerard Alessandrini? Now _he_ can do parody.

Sigh.
