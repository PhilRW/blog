Where's my happiness? When do I get some?

Yesterday afternoon I sobbed for 1/2 hour and then cried myself into a nap on the couch. I wanted to sleep longer but I had a show to do.

Today I get up before the sun to go to work and when I leave work there is no sunlight left in the sky. I stay indoors for 9 hours, the total amount of daytime there is nowadays. An apt metaphor for my waking hours to be filled with darkness.

I just want to sleep through the pain. How am I supposed to smile? Really? Sure, I can distract myself and laugh but when it comes down to just me and the man in the glass, we're both pretty lonesome right about now.

When do I get to be happy again? If even for a little while? When do I get to be happy again? _What _do I do to be happy?

I'm tired and I have to get up at 6am tomorrow.

Now is the winter of our discontent. The son of York is on vacation.
