Last Friday I came home to a gas leak 1 block away. They said it was a 3 or 4 inch line that was cut and it took Xcel a long time to locate it. There was a lot of standing around hoping that things didn't blow up (I'm glad they didn't). They also shut down traffic on a major road during rush hour. Lots of vehicles were trying to cut through our neighborhood without realizing that the only other way out was through the cordoned-off area.

This timelapse condenses about 3.5 hours into about 2 minutes. Although they are not seen, props to the all-volunteer [Boulder Emergency Squad](https://www.boulderrescue.org/) for performing traffic control duty to keep traffic moving on the far side of McCaslin.
