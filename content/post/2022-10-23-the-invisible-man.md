made Alexander lunch and read him several stories.

noticed a radio was dead and not charging properly so I turned it on and moved it to another charger.

took the car to Costco for tires that had taken almost 6 weeks to come in and waited in line for 5-10 minutes to check in the car.

walked back to Costco and walked through the entire store just to get a couple items.

waited in an extra long food court line for a couple slices of pizza.

waited in line for 5-10 minutes (again) to pick up the car from the tire center.

ate a slice of pizza whhile I played with Alexander for another hour.

made him dinner and read several more stories.

finally got a 20-minute break.
