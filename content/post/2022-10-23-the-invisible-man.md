filled out most of my ballot.

played with Alexander before heading outside.

mowed the lawn.

made Alexander lunch and read him several stories.

noticed a radio was dead and not charging properly so I turned it on and moved it to another charger.

took the car to Costco for tires that had taken almost 6 weeks to come in and waited in line for 5-10 minutes to check in the car.

walked to two other stores in high winds while waiting for the tires.

walked back to Costco and walked through the entire store just to get a couple items.

waited in an extra long food court line for a couple slices of pizza.

waited in line for 5-10 minutes (again) to pick up the car from the tire center.

loaded the car, drove it home, unloaded it, put away groceries.

ate a slice of pizza while I played with Alexander for another hour.

made him dinner and read several more stories.

finally got a 20-minute break.

did not take a shower.

did not have lunch.
