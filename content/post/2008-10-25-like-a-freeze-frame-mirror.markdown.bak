Time for another blog entry. What to write about today?

I think it’s time to pause and reflect on things. Like a freeze-frame mirror.

I think of where I am, where I’ve been, and where I’m going. Is there someone special in my life about whom I’d like to shout from the rooftops? Why haven’t I been posting my more usual morose and lonely thoughts to my blog lately? Why haven’t I been writing much of anything on my blog lately? What does purple taste like? Why so many questions?

I guess if anything this blog is an outlet for a habit I’ve formed lately of writing emails about not much in particular.

Stay tuned for further developments in the coming days and/or weeks....
