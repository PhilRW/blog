Since I now have a small (but growing) network of sensors around my house, I thought I'd post a sample of the temperature data coming out of my garage:

[https://www.thingspeak.com/channels/1469/charts/1?timescale=30&days=1&yaxis=Temperature&xaxis=Time&title=Garage](https://www.thingspeak.com/channels/1469/charts/1?timescale=30&days=1&yaxis=Temperature&xaxis=Time&title=Garage)

I also have a light sensor integrated into a [Digi](http://www.digi.com/) [Smart Plug](http://www.digi.com/wiki/developer/index.php/XBee_Smart_Plug) and I'm logging the temperature and on/off status of my [thermostat](http://www.ushomeautomation.com/Notes/TZB20/TZB20.html), with more to come....
