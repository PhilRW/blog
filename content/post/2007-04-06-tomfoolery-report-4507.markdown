Thursday night was a good crowd. It was almost a full house, perhaps
10 short of capacity. The show was very good and we didn’t miss any
words or lines as best I can recall. The crowd was very good and they
kept clapping for a while—we could have done a second bow but were not
prepared for that. Tomorrow night we’ll be ready in case the applause
continues. Lights and tech were good.
