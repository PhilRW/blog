Welcome to the DSA, which, on January 20, 2017, will become the world's newest budding Autocracy. Current similar regimes (see: Russia) eagerly await its arrival, while the dissimilar nation states (our _current_ allies) anticipate with dread. The new Supreme Leader will consolidate power as quickly as he can. He will move to stifle his critics in the media, punish those who oppose him, and start making good on what he's been saying he'd do. Do not hold out hope, or "normalize," as this will only harm your chances in the long run. If you are in a group that he is targeting, you should seriously consider your strategy. You know that scenario you run in your head, "What would _I_ have done as a German in 1933?" Well now's your chance to see if you can learn from history. The quicker you accept this and start to strategize your life, the better off you will be.

Personally, I am glad my passport is up-to-date. I will stay and fight for the Constitution for as long as I am able, but it never hurts to have a backup plan. Should this blog ever disappear, you will know the reason.

See [Autocracy: Rules for Survival](http://www2.nybooks.com/daily/s3/nov/10/trump-election-autocracy-rules-for-survival.html) for more detailed steps on how you too can increase your chances for surviving under Trumpism.
