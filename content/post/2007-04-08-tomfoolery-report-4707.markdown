Our second Saturday went well. Full house. Nick randomly spaced on
the first words to the last verse of “College Days,” and didn’t do the
repatch in Act II for the end of “Œdipus Rex,” consequently Deb’s solo
spot was instead leaves. Tonight’s crowd, unlike last night, got more
warmed up as the evening progressed and were very much into it by the
time “Dope Peddler” rolled around. We took our first second bow tonight
to a standing ovation.




The light cues for “Hunting Song” were way early tonight and we’ll
practice them tomorrow before the house opens. I did notive both 10A and
10B were patched during intermission; I corrected it.
