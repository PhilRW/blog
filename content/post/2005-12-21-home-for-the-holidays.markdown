It’s good to be [the title]. Even driving in Denver is so much more
relaxed. You can actually get somewhere around here on surface streets -
there isn’t a traffic light every two blocks. And the snow is nice. But
the cold is not, especially when your house thermostat is set to 64
degrees and your room is on the top floor.




I can’t say as of right now I’m particularly looking forward to
returning to Los Angeles. I don’t have school, I don’t have a job, so I
don’t have too much to do. But perhaps in a couple weeks I’ll be ready
to leave Denver.
