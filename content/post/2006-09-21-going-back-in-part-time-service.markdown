After four years of sitting in the garage, I’ve decided to put my 1995 Chevy Caprice 9C1 back into limited use, mostly for weekend driving and stuff like that. There are a few repairs I need to tackle, including recharging the A/C 134a refrigerant and finding a replacement bolt for the right front brake caliper (I had nightmares about not being able to stop—now I know why)! But most importantly I recently took care of a non-functioning fuel pump. Turns out the wires had fried but now I have a new pump, too. Included is a picture of the wiring that supplied power to the old fuel pump. Yes, I replaced that part. :)

My Golf TDI sure gets great mileage but boy is the Caprice fun to drive. :)
