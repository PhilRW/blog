Toddler toys have a design problem.

<!--more-->

Aside from them being generally *too loud*, they also tend to have 3-position toggle switches for controlling volume or mode. And they're *always* linear: "off/soft/loud" or "level 1/level 2/level 3" in progression of difficulty level for the kid's developmental skill level. And there's the problem: A toddler with limited fine motor control will toggle off-loud or level1-level3 because they simply can't select the middle position. 

So a simple solution: make the switches go "off/loud/soft" and "level 1/level 3/level 2." This will correspond nicely with their developmental process.
