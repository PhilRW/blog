It's quite simple. Twitter alternatives like BlueSky still do not [federate](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/discussions/1716) (interoperate with the Fediverse). This can mean but one thing: they *want* to keep it a walled garden, while paying lip service to "open source." Which also means but one thing: at some point they will inevitably [enshittify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification), driving users of good conscience (UoGCs) away.

Also, Twitter is horrible and I refuse to have any part of it. Any public safety organization or company that uses them as their primary source of subscriptable information is enragingly techno-impotent. Give us RSS or give us literally nothing.

Not everyone has my technical chops, but surely there should be a requirement for -- at the very least -- public safety organizations directly funded by taxpayer dollars to adhere to some minimum set of technical standards for digital dissemination of public information. Otherwise some [billionaire fuckwad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk) can come along and lock up all of their posts.
