I'd like you to pause for a moment. Take a breath. Look around this blog.

Do you notice something?

More specifically, do you notice not-something?<!--more-->

There are no ads on this website.

There is no way to insert them into my content; the site is now statically generated.

Good God, what am I doing? I have this immensely popular website with *so many visitors* every minute of every day and I'm not taking advantage of that?

We'll see.

For now enjoy the quiet.
