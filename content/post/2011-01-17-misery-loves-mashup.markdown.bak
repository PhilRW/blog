Right now I'm stuck between the lyrics of two songs, "Not a Day Goes By" and "Losing My Mind." I wonder if I could take the sheet music and combine the two. It's not debilitating, just a faded melancholy. Because truly not a day goes by that I don't think of her, or see her face, or hear her voice. In my mind.

P.S. The expected 3rd word of the title is also by the same guy.
