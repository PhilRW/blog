I'm sorry, little Sciuridae, but your speed and angle of attack this morning precluded me from any defensive action. Your decisive trajectory seems to indicate an intent of Suicide by Automobile. Although our space-time matter-energy positioning conflict may not have been lethal, I fear fatality is high in order of probability. Your movements observed in my right side rear-view mirror could signify survival but, alas, more likely indicate pre-mortem convulsions. R.I.P. at 07:45 on Indiana Street.
