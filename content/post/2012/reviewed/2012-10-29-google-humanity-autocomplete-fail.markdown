So I wanted some suggestions to be an electric something for Halloween. I thought I could be a clever pun costume or something. I decided to use Google's search engine autocomplete mechanism for inspiration. I went through all the letters and when I got to X... well... I know it's based on popular searches and your personal search history, but seriously, _who spells zoo with an X?!_
