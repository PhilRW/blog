I agree 100%. However I propose to take it one step further and introduce the jumping ovation. As the standing ovation has become so commonplace as to devalue its original meaning, we should introduce a new form of ovation that not only goes above and beyond the s.o. but also forces the audience member to evaluate the personal cost of said ovation by asking himself, "do I really want to put the effort into _jumping_ for this performance? Was it _that good_?"
