I had to stop and think for a minute just now when I read the acronym "AFAICT" on a discussion board. That reminded me of why I don't use acronyms. Prefacing your sentence with AFAIK, AFAICT, DYK, FWIW, etc. adds absolutely zero to your statement. If it's common enough that you can use an acronym to express the sentiment then it isn't necessary. Stop network bit-pollution. Clean up your writing. :slightly_smiling_face:
