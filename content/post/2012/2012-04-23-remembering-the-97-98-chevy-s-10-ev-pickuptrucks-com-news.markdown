I got to see one of these when I was filming my documentary, _Fueling Change_. One of our subjects owned one. I wonder if he still does?

Also, I just found out that one of my coworkers owns one! In fact he's my supervisor. And he's thinking about selling it. I found out that it may have less than 5,000 miles on it but it needs some electrical wizardry to get it fully functional again. (Too bad I don't know anything about electronics or computers or wiring or stuff like that.)

Tempting, very tempting...
