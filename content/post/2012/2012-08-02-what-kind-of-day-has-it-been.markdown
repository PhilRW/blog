So far my birthday has just been great. I got home last night about an hour after I usually do because my insurance agent meets with me at my work. Just to meet and go over stuff. Then K gets back an hour after THAT with a skittish little foster dog. Then we go to dinner 45 minutes later and eat around 8:45pm. Note I'm usually asleep in bed at 9pm. Oh yes. The dog threw up in the car on the drive to dinner.
The dog shits in the living room after we finally get to bed at 11pm, which I discover -- much to the chagrin of K who has already picked it up without telling me. She thought she'd tell me tomorrow or something. I find my brand new shirt that was a birthday gift has an ink stain on it and it's been through the washer and dryer so it's set in. I put the dog in the bathroom behind a baby gate which she proceeds to chew through and escape from an hour later when I get to work. So I go home and pick up a crate on the way (should have had one already) but the damn dog won't even come to me. She's literally scared shitless which she does behind the couch. She tracks some poo across the rug and I get her outside where she hides at the end of the old dog run. Meanwhile I close the gate to it and get two wasp stings for my trouble. I get some wasp spray, open the gate, get the dog, put her in the crate, put the crate in the house, clean up the crap on the wood floor (rug/carpet will have to wait), and head to work for the second time today and arrive 15 minutes before we're supposed to leave for lunch. That's my day so far.
