Say hello to Serenity. She's a silver 2012 Nissan Leaf SL. I'll have some better pictures later. I shall be her steward for the next two years and 30,000 miles. After crunching some numbers, it was going to cost me just as much to drive around Hermes for the next two years as it would to lease a new vehicle. This was made possible by a ~$9,400 cap reduction from Nissan: they get to keep the federal tax rebate. I shall take this interval to promote EVs among friends, family, and coworkers. Anyone who wants a test ride or a test drive is welcome. :slightly_smiling_face:
