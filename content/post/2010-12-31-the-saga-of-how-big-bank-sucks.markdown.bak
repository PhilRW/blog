title: The Saga of How Big Bank Sucks

1. I make an offer on a house. It's REO property owned by Big Bank.

2. They send signed counter offer.

3. I sign and accept their counter offer and deliver earnest money. Meanwhile, I had a home inspection done.

4. They say they made a mistake on the price and that management won't approve the price **on their own counter offer**.

5. I tell them that they're in breach of contract if they don't sell to me at the agreed price.

6. They point out an ambiguous "weasel clause" that they claim lets them get out of the contract at any time if contract does not meet approval of "senior management," whoever that may be.
