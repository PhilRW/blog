Did I call that one or what? iTunes 4.8 now supports video. You can
buy music videos and such stuff now on the iTunes Music Store. Mark my
words: video playback support will soon follow on iPods. Probably the
iPod Video or something like that. Perhaps the iPod Photo will get a
firmware upgrade to allow video playback to an external monitor or to
the internal screen & headphone jack.




The future is bright for digital filmmakers/content providers.
