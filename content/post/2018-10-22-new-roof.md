After more than a week of installation, our house finally has a new roof. It's 24-gauge metal from [Premium Panels](http://premiumpanels.com/) and installed by [Aspen Contracting](https://www.roofsbyaspen.com/). Here's hoping it lasts a very long time.

The next and final step is to reinstall the [solar panels](https://blog.rosenberg-watt.com/2017/11/01/opportunity-power-knocks/).
