I'm absolutely beaming right now, but I'm trying not to show it, as is my style.

I just had the best meeting with my manager. Apparently I've been doing well. I won't post all the details on here but suffice it to say that it was a very good impromptu meeting. Sort of a "keep up the good work" type of thing, but a bit more specific than that, obviously.
