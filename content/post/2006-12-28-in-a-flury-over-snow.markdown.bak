title: In a Flury over Snow

It was 10:41 in the morning when the snow began to fall at my house in Lakewood. Many people were still bitter over the fact that another storm was moving in: the second blizzard in as many weeks. Instead of giving it the cold shoulder, however, I decided to stay home and do what I normally do: work from home.

If this signals a global climate change then we should buy more snow plows and snowshoes.
