Composer Alan Williams was tonight’s guest in David Bondelevitch’s Directing the Composer Class. I, as the PA, ran the board from the control room, of course. Nice guy, he’s done a lot of stuff, especially Imax. The IMS TV paled in comparison to the 140mm projection system we’re supposed to use with his music, but it still went okay. :)
