Google,

I bet your [Home](https://madeby.google.com/home/) product is pretty cool. I want to get one, but you have to do one thing first: make it support multiple users _better than the Echo_. I don't want to say "switch profile" or some other nonsense. It needs to automatically differentiate between the voices of our household members. I wouldn't mind training it. But it cannot simply assume only one person is using it.

Fix that and I'll get one for _us_.
