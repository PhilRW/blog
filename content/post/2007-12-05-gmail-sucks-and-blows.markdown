title: Gmail sucks and blows

Another reason why I really love running my own email server. Today I tried to log in to my anonymous Gmail account that I created for various identity-protection reasons and i was told that my account was disabled. Disabled. Instantly and without warning. Google sucks and if they ever want to get off my sh*t list they’d better do things right. I have a feeling my account was deleted because of some kind of automated message scanning thing they have going on and not a real live person ever looked at my account activity. That is absolutely the WORST way to run an email service. EVER. I’m a postmaster and proud of it and I would NEVER EVER do things the way Gmail does. But hey, it’s their free service and you play by their rules.

Anyone want an email address in any of _my_ domains? Your email accounts—if they’re with Yahoo, Hotmail, Gmail, or whoever’s the latest “free” provider—are all at risk.
