Was she trying to make a joke or is [Rep. Thompson really that dumb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senfronia_Thompson#Tesla_Direct_Sales_Controversy)? Nevermind -- I just [learned](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senfronia_Thompson) that she's quite old. Just the kind of out-of-touch person the automobile dealers want to keep in office (for whatever the reason).

> Democratic state Rep. Senfronia Thompson criticized the company by saying that “it would have been wiser if Mr. Tesla had sat down with the car dealers first.” But there is no “Mr. Tesla” involved in the company, which is named after the late inventor Nikola Tesla and is founded and run by Elon Musk.
