My most action-packed dashcam video so far: this is from last November when I was driving back from a performance of *[Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown](http://equinoxtheatredenver.dreamhosters.com/women-on-the-verge-of-a-nervous-breakdown-the-musical/)*.

Note: Immediately after the video, the pickup pulled in right behind the police cars. The officers on scene called for the fire department, who arrived quickly. The investigating police detective was quite thrilled to have my video.
