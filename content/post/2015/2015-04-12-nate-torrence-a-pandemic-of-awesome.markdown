It's called [Weird Loners](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3549436/) and I haven't seen it yet, but I hope it does great because Nate is awesome. I only worked with him very briefly on one of my student films at USC, but he was such a joy to work with that I knew he would go far. He's been in supporting roles in movies and TV shows, but this is the first mainstream show I've seen him in where he has a lead role. He's one of those guys you just want to be around because he just has such a positive energy, it'sÂ ~~infectious~~ ~~contagious~~... is there a word that doesn't make it sound like a pandemic? That's it! Nate is a *pandemic* of awesome.

You go, Nate! I hope your show gets picked up for another season.
