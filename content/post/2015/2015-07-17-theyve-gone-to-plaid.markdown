So now the top-end [Tesla](http://www.teslamotors.com/) [Model S](http://www.teslamotors.com/models)Â has a "Ludicrous Speed" option for $10K. Now I'm waiting to see the first Model S to get a nice tartan wrap.

You can't say Elon doesn't have a sense of humor. Did you also know the volume setting on the Model S's sound [system goes to 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7-5io1muSQ)?
