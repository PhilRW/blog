sometimes  

when you feel too much  

you donâ€™t want to feel  

at all




sometimes  

when your heart runs deep  

you can understand  

too much




sometimes  

when you sing a song  

you can help your heart  

to heal




sometimes  

when you say not now  

you will say goodbye  

for good




sometimes  

when a hope seems far  

you must meet it  

part way there




sometimes
