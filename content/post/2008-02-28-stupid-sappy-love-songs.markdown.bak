Also, remind me to publish a blog ranting about stupid sappy love songs. Been there, done that. No thanks. What got me off on this kick is the _Millie_ auditions and listening to those _stupid sappy love songs_ that all the characters sing. I mean, come on, people! Get a grip! What would popular entertainment be without playing on the adolescent hormonal thing we think is love but is really lust? Oh yeah, that’s right: better.

Call me jaded. That’s only because I’m a romantic. Or at least was. Until I hear all these folks singing about their happy endings. Yeah right. **Show me.**

Uh-huh. That’s what I thought. I’ll believe it when it happens.

...Maybe.
