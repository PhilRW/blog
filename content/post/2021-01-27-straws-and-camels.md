This will be a quick post because I have to get back to work. The thing that drove me over the edge to temporarily(?) deactivate my Facebook account was when I considered how someone was talking to me in public on that platform and realizing that she would probably never speak like that to me face to face.

And since there are so many other ways to contact me online[^1][^2][^3][^4], I'll be off Facebook for a while. Who knows? You may even join me on one or more of these platforms. I figure if someone really wants to communicate with me, they'll find a way. Facebook doesn't count anymore.
