I’m quiet in happiness.
I keep my joy to myself,
shared only with those near and dear to me.
Frequently the only postings you’ll find here are when I’m having a down or cold moment in my life.
Or an inspiration.
So if you don’t hear from me in a while
then everything’s fine.
Unless I was hit by a bus.
