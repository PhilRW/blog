Report from Wednesday evening.




Last night went well. There were a coule of flubs by the cast, most
notible Deb and Rob couldn’t seem to agree on the words to the first
verse of “Pollution.” Deb also entered in a strange place during a
vamp in “Irish Ballad,” which had me playing catch-up for a few
measures. Also Rob skipped a beat or two in “New Math” but it was
nothing major and it only happened once. The cast remarked that “Vatican
Rag” went the best ever for them.




The house was full and only a couple seats were empty. I didn’t get a
five minutes call over the headset at the top of the show. I also
forgot to put on my headset until 4 minutes from the end of intermission
because we were chatting backstage. I must have nodded my head a little
too vigorously at the end of “We Will All Go Together” because the
sound and lights went on the last word “go” instead of when they were
supposed to. It didn’t really matter, though, because I rather liked how
it worked that time and the audience still enjoyed it. They kept
clapping all the way up to the beinning of “Marines” and one person even
clapped along in time with the music for a while (trying to start a
trend, no doubt). The lights q’s were very good, but I heard that they
were not repatched during intermission. This made “Hunting Song” look a
little strange.
