Here's the thing, Comcast, and listen up: I want my PDF billing statement in my email. If you make me click on a link, authenticate with two factors, select the account, select the billing statement, and save it to disk, it saves me *no effort* vs opening an envelope and scanning a piece of paper. In fact, it's worse, because I can't reliably automate your stupid paperless billing process enough to integrate it into my workflow.

And I don't want you to generate it on the fly on your website because you could change it at whim. I want a copy when you send it to me.

The same goes for all of you online/paperless billing imbeciles. Give me PDF or give me **nothing**!
