It was _relatively_ painless to move from my self-hosted blog at https://blog.rosenberg-watt.com/ to the WordPress.com-hosted one here at https://philrw.wordpress.com/. All of the content is the same (with the exception of a few videos nobody ever watched, anyway), and now I don't have to worry about uptime and such: the folks at WordPress.com will do that for me.

So the web site address is new: make a note of it. Other than that, it's still the same old boring website. If you're following via RSS, you may want to update your URLs.
