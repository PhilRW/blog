US-36 drivers: Since you're new to these lane markings, I'll clue you in on something that California drivers have known for a while:Â **DO NOT CROSS DOUBLE WHITE LINES!**

[caption id="attachment_85690" align="aligncenter" width="660"][![do not do this](http://philrw.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/2015-04-30-crossing-double-white-1024x5761.png)](http://philrw.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/2015-04-30-crossing-double-white.png) do not do this[/caption]

Double white lines are the same as double yellow lines in regards to crossing them: DON'T DO IT! The only difference is that the white color indicates that traffic is flowing in the _same_ direction, while yellow indicates traffic flowing in the _opposite_ direction on either side of the line.

Hopefully this information will help you avoid a traffic ticket when entering/exiting the HOT lanes.
