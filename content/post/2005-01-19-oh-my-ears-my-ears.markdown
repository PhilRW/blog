Went to the 77th Annual Academy Awards Sound Editing Bakeoff last night. Up for nomination were _The Polar Express_, _Collateral_, _Spider-Man 2_, _The Day After Tomorrow_, _The Incredibles_, _Ray_, and _The Aviator_. Were I a voting member I’d choose _Incredibles_, _Collateral_, and _Polar Express_,
probably in that order. But man were those clips loud. I’m glad I sat
in the back and next time I’ll bring ear plugs. Seriously.
