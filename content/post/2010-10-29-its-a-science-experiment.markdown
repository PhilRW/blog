Just like Doc and Marty, I'm doing a little science experiment of my own. It could also end in a spectacular exploding train wreck. I'm going to try integrating my blog, Twitter, and Facebook. These things _should_ happen:<!--more-->



	
  1. Posting in my blog _should _create a new twitter post with a link to the new blog entry, and Twitter _should_ update my Facebook status accordingly.

	
  2. Posting in Twitter _should _create a new blog entry and update my Facebook status.

	
  3. Changing my status in Facebook _should _update Twitter and create a corresponding blog post. Facebook _should_ not be able to update Twitter 'cause Facebook kinda sucks.


If it doesn't go as planned, here is what _could_ happen:



	
  1. Twitter and my blog _could _get stuck in a feedback loop where they don't recognize which service created which update and consequently destroy each other.

	
  2. Facebook _could _not be able to update Twitter. Confirmed: at this time the Twitter for Facebook app is only unidirectional.

	
  3. My blog _could _crash and burn, exploding in a gigantic fireball that takes seven years' worth of posts with it.

	
  4. Nothing at all _could _happen.


So here goes nothing... I'm about to press the Publish button... in 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...
