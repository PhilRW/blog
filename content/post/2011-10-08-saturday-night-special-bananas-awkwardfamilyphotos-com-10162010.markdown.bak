Just so so so so so so so so so wrong. I had already made it through the Awkward Hall of Fame to this one, and it made me laugh so hard I cried. Normally that would be great but I was backstage in the orchestra pit about to start a number. My snorting was the only sound coming from the pit for about 30 seconds.

Check out their hall of fame while you're over there.
