title: Excess Weight, Fighting With or With?
wordpress_id: 2688
---

I just got a spam with the subject: **Win in combat with excess kilos!**

Does this mean that I'm supposed to gain weight in order to triumph in battle or that I'm already in combat with the excess weight and I've been commanded to succeed? I'm so confused... I just want to do the right thing...
