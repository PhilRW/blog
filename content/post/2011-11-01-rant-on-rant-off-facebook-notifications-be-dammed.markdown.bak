title: 'Rant On, Rant Off: Facebook Notifications Be Dammed'
wordpress_id: 3831

Okay, let me just rant for a minute here. I have turned off ALL notifications from Facebook to my email. And when I say ALL, I mean **_ALL_** notifications. I don't want to get a single email from Facebook saying I have to go to their site and read a message. I want to manually type "facebook.com" into my browser's address bar and peruse messages, notifications, invites, pokes, picks, pukes, punks, plucks, pucks, and porks when it's convenient for me. Which means maybe once a day or so.

At this point you may be thinking, "He's pretty anti-Facebook. Why is he even on it?" I'm not anti-Facebook. I like keeping my friends in a tidy little relatively self-organizing corner of the Internet. And the "why is he even on it" thing? Are you serious? How can you _not_ have a presence on Facebook nowadays?

Anyway, the whole point of this rant is that I consciously and deliberately disabled all email notifications from Facebook. That took quite a few clicks. Then out of the blue I get a notification from a group that I was added to. Without my permission. Seriously, Facebook? You let people add me to groups without my permission? Where's the "ask first" checkbox in the settings when it comes to that stuff? Did I miss something? I may have. Facebook changes more frequently than a whore on a hot summer night. I don't know what that means.

Facebook seems to have this history of trying to do semi-sleazy things with your profile data. Like the several times you automatically get opted-in to features such as using your personal data on ads that appear on your friend's screens. That was a no-no. And other little examples. They automatically assume everyone wants their new "features" automatically. Think the other way around, Facebook.

They're also a bit of a walled garden, but I won't go into that for now.

So just stop sending me countless emails of the pointless prattle that people perpetually post. Period.
