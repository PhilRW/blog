Why can’t I be like everyone else? I want to be able to go to noisy, crowded bars and have fun. I want to enjoy... you know... people. Why can’t I be like other people who like to laugh and drink and dance and rock out to very very very loud music?

Why do I have to be the loneliest in a crowd?  :(
