title: Stuff About Me, Having Little Empathy
wordpress_id: 84980

Let me state my core philosophy in six words: **DON'T SPEND MORE THAN YOU HAVE**. Now let me re-state if with colorful adult emphasis added: **DON'T FUCKING SPEND MORE THAN YOU FUCKING HAVE**. This applies to karma, bonus points, reserve energy, favors, and, of course, _money_.

There are (were?) some exceptions for me: lower-interest loans for things like grad school and a mortgage (but even grad school is contestable). How about using credit cards for personal expenses? I'm cool with that as long as you absolutely pay it off 100% at the end of each billing cycle, every time. No fees, no interest, no exceptions. PERIOD. I only failed at this _once_ in my life and it was annoying as all hell to have to pay the credit card company interest. INTEREST! Can you believe that?! The credit card company got MY MONEY for FREE because I goofed. I had the money, I just missed the deadline by a couple of days because my mind lapsed and my reminder system failed. Stupid, stupid.

Bank fees are another thing that eats me up... in fact, the whole paying money for money thing just rubs me the wrong way, and now I may have better insight as to why.<!--more-->

We did [Strengths Finder 2.0](http://www.strengthsfinder.com/) here at work recently, and while it is a bit of a gimmicky, corporate, trendy exercise, it did provide some insights into my innate strengths. I am very heavily strategicly minded, future-oriented, and deliberate in my decision making. Anyone who knows me can observe that about me, but it gets to the core of my being and why I find it infuriating and inexcusable when people fall into the same wasteful habits and avoidable mistakes time after time, and this applies especially to money.

So knowing that I plan ahead several steps and anticipate future moves, it is obviously an _inexcusable sin_ to have to mortgage your own future because you either want something you can't afford and you want it **now** (like a little baby or otherwise emotionally manipulated consumer drone), or you failed to plan ahead enough to take care of your own basic wants and needs, and you now have to borrow money from your future self _by making the evil corporations that control the world that much richer_. "Oh sure," you say, "it's only a few bucks here and there. I can handle it." Fuck that. If they want my money, they're going to have to offer me a bigger value-add than some worthless airline points or some other stupid points/reward system that I can only use in their already overpriced store. It's corporate [DP](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dp), and you're the one getting fucked. It's a great emotional play on our vulnerabilities as humans, and since we humans are the greatest justifiers of our own actions, the credit card companies give us an easy out: It's okay if we spend money on interest, because that money turns into "points," which in reality are almost worthless. Do this: look at your statements for the past year and total up how much you paid in bank fees and interest and then see if that amount equals the value of the stuff you bought with their ridiculous "points" system in that same timeframe. Who won that little currency conversion? You can be damn sure that the banks came out ahead on this one.

(You _do_ keep an account register somewhere, don't you? Or are you doomed to repeat your own personal history because you can't learn from it? ...Because you don't _have_ an accounting of where your money goes? Please tell me you took basic "being a responsible modern human" sometime in the history of your academic life.)

So to those of you who know me, know that I have little to no sympathy for you when you complain about the _consequences of your own actions_. Part of being an adult is learning from your previous mistakes and _avoiding_ them by altering your own behavior next time around. So long as you are willing to live with the consequences of your actions -- and that you understand ALL of them, not just the short-term instant gratification but the incredibly powerful consequences of long-term LOSSES due to lost opportunity for compound interest and the like -- then we have no problem. But I must ask you to think ahead. I do it naturally, but if you need _HELP DOING IT_, you must ask for it. And please do. I'm really really good at it. NOTE: this means that you must admit first to yourself that you're not as good at it as you could be. Like driving. Most of us think we're above average drivers. Statistically that's impossible.

That leads to another of my core philosophies, and the last one for this blog entry: **WE MUST CONSTANTLY STRIVE TO IMPROVE OURSELVES**. Discipline. Planning. Taking action. Learning from our mistakes._ Learning without action is life wasted._

P.S. The Empathy strength was my penultimate strength on my list (33 out of 34 total possible strengths), meaning it is not something I am naturally good at. I'm sure after reading this, you can understand why.
