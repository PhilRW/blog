So for the longest time I thought that the [Boulder BrandMeister repeater](https://brandmeister.network/?page=repeater&id=310819) had a problem because I was seeing full-strength unmodulated-FM-carrier style interference on the output frequency of 445.050 MHz. But I did a little foxhunting :fox_face: and determined the noise was coming from ... inside my house. :house: Spooky!​ :ghost:

With some primitive directional radio finding techniques :radio:, I determined which half of the house I thought it was coming from and then I started unplugging/turning off electronics. Lo and behold our LED HDTV :tv: was causing the noise! And it wasn't particularly broad-spectrum: ±25KHz from the frequency and the noise was gone.

Unlucky, I guess? Or the other thing? I don't know. But I do know that if we want to use that repeater from our house, we're going to have to turn off the TV first. :stuck_out_tongue:
