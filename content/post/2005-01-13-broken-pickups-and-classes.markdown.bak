Wednesday on the way home from class I noticed an unoccupied pickup in the intersection of Hoover and 31st St. It’s front left suspension broke, apparently while making a left turn onto NB Hoover. Sheesh. I helped out with “traffic control,” if you can call it that, for 10 mins. or so until a flatbed arrived to haul the sorry pickup away. I can’t imagine my car getting to such a state where the suspension simply breaks. But I guess it happens.... because, well, it did.

In other news, Thursday’s classes look great. Doe Mayer teaches CTPR 531 Thurs 9-12 and it’s going to be an awesome albeit hard working experince. And [Jack Epps Jr.](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0258390/), the writer of _Top Gun_ (among others) teaches Advanced Playscript Analysys. He seems easygoing and he’s entertaining and articulate. The work load doesn’t seem that intense (to balance out the 531/Prepping the Doc class). In the end I think this will be a good semester. It certainly seems that way in the beginning.<!--more-->

On the other hand, I’ll need a chainsaw to hack my way through all the red tape for **registering** for 581B. Oy. Same possibly goes for CTPR 554, Advanced Sound with Tom Holman and [Chris Jenkins](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0420804/).
