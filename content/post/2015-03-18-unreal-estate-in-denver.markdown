Just in case you're wondering if we're ever going to find a house, so are we.<!--more-->

A quick survey of [my favorite <del>social</del> timesuck website](http://www.reddit.com) reveals some local discussion on that very topic. [maddslacker](http://www.reddit.com/user/maddslacker) has the top, albeit obvious, comment in the innocuously titled [Denver real estate prices](http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/2vz6vp/denver_real_estate_prices/) thread :


<blockquote>High demand, low supply.</blockquote>


Then there's last month's [Denver Post article on the record low supply of houses](http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_27517897/metro-denver-struggles-record-low-supply-homes-sale). [That discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/2vratx/metro_denver_struggles_with_a_record_low_supply/)'s top comment by [HRHill](http://www.reddit.com/user/HRHill) seems to reflect the prevailing attitude that homebuilders are not in touch with what the market needs:


<blockquote>And the homes that _are_ being built to satisfy the need are $400-$500k McMansions with no yards that're 10 feet away from each other, at least on my side of Denver.</blockquote>


[Dontthinkfly](http://www.reddit.com/user/Dontthinkfly) vents on the topic in [This housing market is insane...](http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/2vu3jt/this_housing_market_is_insane/) and [jadeoracle](http://www.reddit.com/user/jadeoracle) gets the most upvoted comment when he relates his tumultuous journey:










<blockquote>Went through this last year. I sold my place really quick, and then it took me 5 months to find a place. I saw probably over 150 homes in a few months time period, searching literally every day. I would see properties just listed and they would have an offer on them that day. Many I got into bidding wars in pure desperation. I saw my price range jump 50% higher than I had originally wanted, and still was having trouble. After months of searching, I started to give up hope. And then I thought about renting...and gave up on that too. I kicked myself in to high gear, feeling like a crazy person, seeing properties literally within the hour they were listed, and finally I made an offer that was accepted. I was ecstatic, I found my dream home...and then came the inspection...and if failed failed failed it miserably. So backed out. And started the process all over. I eventually found a place in my initial price range that has been perfect for me. But hell will have to freeze over for me to go back into a housing market like this again.</blockquote>










Finally, looking back six months reveals [When will the rental/housing market bubble burst/plateau in Denver](http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/2g53y2/when_will_the_rentalhousing_market_bubble/), where [JaySuds](http://www.reddit.com/user/JaySuds) writes:










<blockquote>It's not going to cool down for a while. House prices were stagnant for many years in Denver. Now things are taking off again. On my block in Platt Park, Tripointe Homes is putting in ~2000 sq ft single family homes for $650-800k. I've had my house appraised twice this year and in a 3 month period it went up 8% or so, compared to 8% for the prior 6 year period.</blockquote>

So... we're open to alternate ideas, including mobile homes, [tiny houses](http://tinyhouseblog.com/), RVs, or whatever. Does anybody have a large lot in Boulder/Louisville/Superior where we could park a trailer? We'd pay you rent!

Or, if you have a home to sell, call us! Just don't expect to find a place to live anytime soon.
