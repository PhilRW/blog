I got my car back today. Hooray indeed. Now that I’ve realigned the steering wheel (myself) I also have to figure out how to stop the noise that is coming from the pedal area. I think when they took my car apart they didn’t completely put it back together again and now I can hear (and smell) the engine through the firewall. If I were emperor all incompetents would be punished. Does anybody even care anymore or are they just too lazy or stupid to get a simple thing done right?

On the plus side, though, my steering now works. It seems I’ve traded a major problem for a minor one.

sigh.
