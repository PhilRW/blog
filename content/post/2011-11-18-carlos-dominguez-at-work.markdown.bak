Carlos Dominguez gave a great talk today at work. I like his style, philosophy, and what he had to say. Because of how my brain works, I thought he was saying "gen wires" or "gen wireds" when he was actually referring to "gen Y'ers." Ha. I guess the former was more appropriate, as we are wired in. Being on the cusp of Y myself, I think I can help bridge the gap a bit between the pre-gen-Y'ers and the real younguns.

At any rate, Carlos is a great speaker and I encourage you to [seek him out](http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxPresidio-Carlos-Dominguez-T).
