iOS is looking old, isn't it? I mean, as far as I know, it doesn't have widgets, it forces you to keep certain apps on the home screen (Android lets you remove them, even if they must stay installed), and it's just a bit too cartoony for my taste.

To each his own, but to me, iOS is getting a bit long in the tooth.
