So, coming back to Denver for a couple weeks after 6 months, I drive back in my Golf TDI expecting to be able to fuel up with some B20. But no! There are not _more_ biodiesel stations now, there are _fewer_! Apparently Offen Petroleum doesn’t sell it at the moment and although Blue Sun says they’re going to open up 10 more filling stations in a week-and-a-half, the closest place I can get biodiesel is now further away in Commerce City! Yaargh! Luckily I bought some 5 gallon diesel containers so I don’t have to fuel up too often. Still, what a pain in the ass. This is exactly the kind of thing that needs to go in _Fried Fuel._
