title: Reunions, Sonatas, and Jobs, oh my!

My ten-year high school reunion was last weekend. I paid *cough* 80-plus dollars for my single ticket. Cash bar. Noisy venue not conducive to talking (think concrete catacomb). Merely adequate catering. No live music or entertainment. No DJ or karaoke. One poorly-uprezed video “slideshow,” most persons being unrecognizable due to the fact of the extreme pixellation and compression artifacting. Crummy “memory book” was basically a multipage booklet with all of our addresses in it. Plus I was one of the only single people there. Oh well, I guess it was good to see a _few_ of my old high school friends, though I had more friends in grades slightly above or below me. They would have been fun to see, too. Facebook.

After that “reunion,” however, I had an audition for _You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown_. Actually the audition was the afternoon before but last night (Monday) I had callbacks. They were fun. I accepted the role of Schroeder this morning at 9 am. In my opinion I get the best number of the show, “Beethoven Day.” I also met a pretty cute girl at the callbacks but after leaving started figuratively kicking myself ‘cause I didn’t even get her number. Not to worry, though, since she’s in the show as Lucy. She, Charlie Brown, and Snoopy carry the show. Probably in that order.

In other news I had a call last week with Burl Amsbury, VP of Operations at [Thought Equity](http://www.thoughtequity.com/). I don’t really know how to describe this company other than a stock footage company, but they apparently reinvent the company every six months or so. I’m interviewing with the VP of Ops, the CTO, and the President next Monday, in that order. They could make me the new “Metadata Director.” How do I describe the job? I’m not quote sure yet. It will involve a lot of high-level conceptualization and analysis of metadata structure and flow aimed towards improving efficiency, automation, and/or optimization. And frequent trips to the “refinery” in Laramie.

Stay tuned for more on the performance and job fronts. Apparently it’s in my contract to sell a certain number of tickets to the show or I don’t get paid. To quote my character’s friend, “Good grief!”
