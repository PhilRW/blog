This once again inspires me to remind you to **USE S/MIME ENCRYPTION** on any email you send that may have sensitive information in it. And by "sensitive information," I mean information that you don't want other people or companies to know about FOREVER.

Using email with S/MIME encryption is like having a safe deposit box at your bank. They store the items in a box in their vault (the encrypted email on their server) but it takes both of your keys to open it (theirs = server access, yours = private S/MIME decryption key). They know you have a box in their vault but they do not know the contents. Except whenever you _don't_ use S/MIME email encryption, it's like allowing anyone at the bank to open your safe deposit box _at any time_ andÂ _without your key_. And I'm willing to wager that you almost never use S/MIME encryption on your sensitive emails.

Ask me how. [It's easy](https://www.instantssl.com/ssl-certificate-products/free-email-certificate.html).
