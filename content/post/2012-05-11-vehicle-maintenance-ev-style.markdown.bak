I looked at the [maintenance schedule for the 2012 Mitsubushi i](http://web.archive.org/web/20120131064230/http://www.mitsubishicars.com:80/media/owners/pdf/2012MY_Warranty_iMiev_Complete.pdf). I will summarize the entire thing right here:



	
  1. Replace cabin air purifier filter every year.

	
  2. Replace the brake fluid every three years.

	
  3. Replace the motor coolant and heater fluid every 20 years.


The end.
