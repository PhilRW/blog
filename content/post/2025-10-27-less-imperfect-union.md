I have a few suggestions for USA 2.0. Here they are, in no particular order.

<!--more-->

- Term limits on all public offices, elected and appointed.
- Maximum age limits on all public offices, with mandatory retirement and automatic disqualification.
- A requirement of all public officials to be referred to in the press by the title of the office with no mention of the individual's name, until that person is no longer in office.
- Each member of congress shall be paid exactly $1 annual salary. They shall not be allowed to recieve renumeration or donations of any kind from anyone during their service and for a duration of time after their release from office equal to their time served in office.
- All voting shall be ranked-choice.
- Mandatory voting.
- Repeal the 2nd amendment.
- Minimum IQ standards for public officials.
- Maximum net worth cap at $999,999.99. All income above that level is taxed at 100%.
- Corporations are no longer legal persons.

Yes there are technical difficulties with many of these. But it's a start.
