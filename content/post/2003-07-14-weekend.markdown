Saturday and Sunday I worked the Colorado MS150 with ARES District 10.

They put me with an EMT and my tactical was MED 3. We floated up and down the course both days, using lots of fuel along the route (I took Prometheus). I got up at 0430 on Sat. and 0415 on Sun. It went from Longmont to Estes Park the 1st day and back the 2nd day. I am very tired.

I’m friggin’ exhausted, but that’s also partly because I just worked out.
