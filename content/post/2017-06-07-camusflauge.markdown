In all ways that matter, we are alone.

We may walk with others

We may laugh with others

We may talk with others

We may cry with others

These externalities do not define us

They reflect us.

Who cares to know another soul

To express earnest interest in the inner workings of an( )other?

For some this is not reality

But it is mine

And for that it is all of yours.
