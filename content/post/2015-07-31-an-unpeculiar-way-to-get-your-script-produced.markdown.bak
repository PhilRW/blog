The way to get your ideas made into a movie is to create them in some other media. Hollywood will then suck them up and turn them into films.

Congrats to [Randy](http://www.ransomriggs.com) for his imaginative and successful [books](http://www.ransomriggs.com/miss_peregrine.php) and here's to them becoming a successful [film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1935859/) franchise. I'm enjoying watching his career develop almost as much as reading his work.

P.S. Sorry, Randy, I hope that Hollywood "sucking them up" doesn't turn out to be a double entendre.
