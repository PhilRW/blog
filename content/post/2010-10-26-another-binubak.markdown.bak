Another binubak': _briije nyekker_, related to this article:

[Charlie Sheen hospitalized after 'adverse' drug reaction - CNN.com](http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/celebrity.news.gossip/10/26/charlie.sheen.hospitalized/index.html?eref=rss_topstories&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_topstories+%28RSS%3A+Top+Stories%29).

Perhaps a _briije nyekker_ is some sort of Northern Eurpoean person who gawks at trusses and other forms structures that support elevated ground transportation?
