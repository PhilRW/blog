Last night at the annual Los Angeles County Disaster Communications
Service general membership meeting April Moell, WA6OPS, spoke about the
Hospital Disaster Communications service in Orange County. Her brief
lecture was informative and spoke about the nature of hospital
communications in an emergency situation. To my knowledge, DCS doesn’t
do anything like this. But it is what I’d hoped to be doing when I
joined DCS. Emergency communications. So far we have not had one single
activation in which I have participated in the 3 years I have been with
DCS. April pointed out that there are two basic structures: the
RACES/DCS/ACS structure in which hams are tied to a particular
government agency, and the ARES structure, in which ham groups form
agreements with entities and are not tied to one specific served agency.
I believe the latter has a greater chance for growth. The big
difference is that the former requires some sort of administrative
official to request activations, following which hams are sent to
assignments, and the latter allows hams to self-deploy according to
established protocols, thereby saving valuable time. It’s a top-down vs
bottom-up approach. I think I will look for an organization that
utilizes the latter, if merely for my own sanity: I cannot stand the
bureaucratic nonesense that gets in the way of actually doing what we
want to do: get communications back up in an emergency situation where
minutes count.
