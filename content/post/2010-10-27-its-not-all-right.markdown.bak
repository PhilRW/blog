title: It's Not All Right

I miss her greatly today.

I want to hear her voice again, see her smile, feel her touch.

I thought I would be all right.

But I was wrong.

I distract my self with anything -- everything I can think of. But the emptiness is still there, shouting through the din, slowly devouring me with its silent pain. Always.

Always.

A huge part of my heart is missing.
