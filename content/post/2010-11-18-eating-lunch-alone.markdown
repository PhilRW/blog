title: Eating Lunch Alone

Someone I once knew openly pondered about folks who eat alone in restaurants.

Today I was the guy eating alone. Like most days. Only today it was in public.

The short answer is: they eat because they're hungry. They eat alone because they want to. Or they don't have anyone to eat lunch with. There were other people at tables for one. They didn't look particularly lonely or sad.

Truth be told, they forgot to ask me if I wanted my order to go and I figured eh, what the heck, I'd get out of the office for 15 minutes longer anyway.
