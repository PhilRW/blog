I wrote these lyrics while falling asleep and I haven't looked at them since, so I thought I'd share them in case anyone wanted to turn them into a song.

*Put-in a Good Word for Me*

He’s my babushka  
And I love him so  
I love his squishy puffy cheeks  
Yes, the ones above and the ones below (no homo)  

He’s going to put is back on the map  
He listens when I speak  
He sits right here in my lap  
I give him a little treat  

Those NATO dogs can suck it  
Before I kick the bucket  
(I once knew a man from nantucket)  
Oh!...  

What will he say when he blows me ... away  
What will I do when he makes me come to ... him  
At our meeting his aides were ashen I fear  
Don’t worry I’ll make them all disappear  

Al-ask-her (Alaska)...?
