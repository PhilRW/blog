Dear Friends and Family,

Why do you endorse me for skills that you have not personally witnessed me perform, especially whenÂ you may have never worked with me in a professional capacity? Are you willing to vouch to the entire world that I am good at rerecording mixing? Would you stake your professional reputation on it? Do you even know what rerecording mixing is?

Let's make those endorsements mean something.
