I just read that Hamburg's average temperature is 9°C.

And now I just figured out how to get Americans to use the metric system for temperatures. Climate change. As the Earth heats up, Americans will want to use the Celsius scale to make things _seem_ colder. 100 degrees (F) outside? Not a problem! It's actually only in the upper 30s!
