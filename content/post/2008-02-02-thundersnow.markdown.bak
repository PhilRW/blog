It’s thundersnowing. Right now. In Lakewood. No, I’m not making this up.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundersnow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundersnow)

It started with a very light snowfall. Then there was an incredibly bright flash of light that lit up the sky, like someone standing outside my window with a camera flash. Then about 5 seconds later, a huge, KA-BOOOM! It happened a few more times and it’s now more like sleet. But not really. I think the correct precipitation is “snow pellets.” So I guess it should be called thundersnowpelleting instead.

21:36 - Now the Lakewood Police are reporting they can’t get up the hills because it’s “like an ice rink” out there.
