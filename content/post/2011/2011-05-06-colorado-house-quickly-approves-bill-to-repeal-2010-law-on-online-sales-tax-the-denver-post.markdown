I posted this not because I think the article is particularly important, but I read this one sentence ten times and still can't make sense of it. Would somebody please explain this sentence to me?


<blockquote>If Stephens' bill passes, it would mark the third of a dozen laws repealing tax breaks for businesses and passed in 2010 to be undone this year.</blockquote>
