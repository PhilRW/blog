Dammit, people! Secure your damm email accounts with better passwords! And _change_ them once in a while! You're all getting _hacked_ and then they steal your address book and then impersonate you and then my email address is on spammer's lists _forever_! AOL email seems to be particularly vulnerable. Howabout _not_ using an email service that is almost as old as the Internet itself? Just a thought.

Also you may want to avoid using third-party sites that save your email username/password combo as your risk of being hacked increases exponentially the more of those kind of sites you use.
