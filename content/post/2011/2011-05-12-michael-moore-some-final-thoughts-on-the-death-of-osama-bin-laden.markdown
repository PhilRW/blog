Most of what Mr. Moore says here makes sense, regardless of his politics. [Read it](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-moore/some-final-thoughts-on-th_1_b_861071.html) and decide for yourself. Not all of his logic holds up 100%, but the sentiment is there. For the most part, I'm with you, Michael. A couple points he makes:

>We did exactly what bin Laden said he wanted us to do: Give up our freedoms (like the freedom to be assumed innocent until proven guilty), engage our military in Muslim countries so that we will be hated by Muslims, and wipe ourselves out financially in doing so.

> ...

> Assuming it was possible to take him alive, I think his victims, the future, and the restoration of the American Way deserved better.
