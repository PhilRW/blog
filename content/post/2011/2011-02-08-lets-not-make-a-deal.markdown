title: Let's (not) Make A Deal.

Asset Management Company's lawyer sent a letter to my lawyer suggesting that I negotiate with them further on price. Read into it what you will, but at this point AMC still hasn't offered me any better deal than anyone else could get on the house.

How about this, Mr. Middleman: you offer me a better deal on the house than anyone else, in light of our situation, and then we'll talk. Validate my position first and then you'll find I'm much more agreeable to negotiation. It needn't be an admission of guilt, just a demonstration of business acumen heretofore lacking.
