Here's where I am on the whole house debacle:

My attorney believes there is a valid sales contract. After speaking with the Attorney Infact for Big Bank, he got the feeling that something wasn't right or that he was hiding something. This is above the level of the real estate agent, who is acting primarily as a broker/messenger and whom I believe is an innocent party in this matter.

I just had an interesting discussion with a coworker. He said the word "scam" and I immediately thought that it could be a possibility. Not only of scamming from me, but from Big Bank. You see, the middle man Mr. Middleman is representing the bank on this deal but they don't necessarily know the details of what he's doing. A lot of "ifs" have to fall into place, but _if _Middleman were running some sort of scam involving getting more money out of me and only reporting the original signed contract sales amount to Big Bank and thereby skimming the difference, then it could be very intriguing. I'm not saying that this is what's happening or that it's even possible, but it's just one exciting possibility. Other possibilities include fraud or misrepresentation on Middleman's part, or even illegal business practices. They just want me to go away at this point and I want to figure out what in the hell is going on here, even if I don't get the original house I wanted. If my investigation were to uncover a larger plot to defraud buyers and/or banks, it could be _very satisfying_. The [Erin Brockovich](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0195685/) of the recent foreclosure crisis!

Another possibility I'm exploring is purchasing another house while continuing to investigate what's actually going on with Big Bank and Asset Management Company. Is it just sloppy work? Simple mistakes? Or is it fraud? I wish I were an investigator. Does anyone want to take on a project suitable for investigative journalism?

But in the meantime, I just want a house.
