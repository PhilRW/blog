I sealed the grout and the dishwasher, toekicks, and most of the trim pieces are in. I have yet to [Waterlox](http://www.waterlox.com) the countertops (although they are already tung oiled), caulk the edges, fasten the sink, buy a faucet, hook up the plumbing, and put on a few more trim pieces. Oh, and I need a 30" electric range. Anyone have one? I also need a microwave and eventually a [GE IM6 icemaker kit](http://products.geappliances.com/ApplProducts/Dispatcher?REQUEST=SpecPage&Sku=IM6) for my fridge.
