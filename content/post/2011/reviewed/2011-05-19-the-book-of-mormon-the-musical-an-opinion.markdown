_The Book of Mormon_ is exactly what you would expect it to be. Stone and Parker (_South Park_) teamed up with Lopez (_Avenue Q_) and made an old fashioned musical with modern irreverence. At least that's what the critics and marketing say.<!--more-->

True, the music is poppy and catchy. The lyrics are funny if not particularly clever. So far I have listened to it once in a setting where I cannot devote 100% of my attention, but already I have heard very distinct musical references to the end of "Defying Gravity" from _Wicked_, "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen, and "You Can't Stop the Beat" from _Hairspray_. On one hand, it makes you feel good to know that you can catch all these musical references; after all, it takes a certain depth of musical memory/knowledge to get all the references that the score makes. But on the other hand, it makes you a little sad to know that the most buzzed-up shows nowadays are simply satirically warped afterimages of previous works. Innovation by replication?

Perhaps that is how musicals have always been: retelling previously-written stories by adding music that evokes previously-written songs. Rogers and Hammerstein certainly did it. And _The Book of Mormon_ certainly does it, too. But not all new shows have to be old hat. _[Title of Show]_ requires a certain high level of musical theater geekiness that even I cannot claim, but its plot and music are more than predominantly original. Even Schwartz's score to _Wicked_, although heavily pop music-influenced, still feels more original than the score to _The Book of Mormon_.

The Act II number, "Joseph Smith, American Moses," is straight out of "Small House of Uncle Thomas" from _The King and I_, which, ironically enough, was yet another book-within-a-book. So some day the entire scope of musical theater will become a never-ending, ever-accelerating, vicious self-referential cyclone that ultimately consumes itself?

I hope that day has not already arrived.

But on the plus side, the numbers are really catchy, even in spite of the obviously over-autotuned Elder Price and the show's superfluous, if entertaining, sensibilities.
