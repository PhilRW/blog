It looks to me like Apple is moving Mac OS X towards an interface similar to their touch-only devices like the iPhone, iPad, and iPod. I would surely like to see a full-on Apple computer running OS X but in a touchscreen/tablet format. Perhaps with a bigger screen I could use it for one purpose I deem the iPad's display too small: digital sheet music (for piano).
