I'm freakin' out just a little bit. I just did a Google search for results from my blog and below the results is a picture of me with the text "you shared this." It also shows up under my personal website, LinkedIn profile, and (of course) Google Plus/Profile result. Spooooooky.However, it should be noted that I knew what I was getting into when I posted all that stuff online: that's not the point. The point is that G's search results now seem to recognize that I authored them in the first place.
