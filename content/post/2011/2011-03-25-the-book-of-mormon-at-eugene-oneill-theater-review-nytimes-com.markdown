Hmm. Ben certainly likes the show. I have neither heard nor seen anything of the show, but combining the overtly childish melodies of _Avenue Q_ with the irreverent sensibilities of _South Park_ can certainly make for a hilariously entertaining time.

I worry that in this era of post-postmodernist self-referential musicals, the references to musicals past these shows evoke -- nay, rely upon -- may be lost on those who are unfamiliar with the historical lexicography and stylistic taxonomy of the genre. Much like a theatergoer who is unfamiliar with _The Glass Menagerie_ and who goes to see the Chris Durang one act "For Whom the Southern Belle Tolls," I fear that the deeper jokes can be lost on the vox populace and, while entertaining on the surface, these shows may not stand the test of time.

However, history shall be the only judge for these new crude, crass, and poppy shows. I shall enjoy listening to the score of _any_ new musical as I am a fanatic for the genre.

...But then again, there was _In the Heights_... :P
