So I finally made it to LA in one piece. My alternator went out before Flagstaff but fortunately I made it to Chino Valley okay. I was delayed three days as Roger from Roger’s Automotive found an alternator but fortunately my warranty policy covered it all. I left Chino Valley 0745 and arrived at Troyland 1415. The next day (Friday) I made a trip to pick up some of my stuff from Canyon Country and ended up seeing a David Lee Roth concert at the Universal Amphitheatre. I crashed overnight at my 2nd cousins’, drove back to South Central picking up a $35 microwave enroute, carried _more_ stuff up the stairs, and went to a party at Greg’s. And that’s the story of how I got to LA this time.
