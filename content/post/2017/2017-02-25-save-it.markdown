Ya see, folks, Bannon may actually be a strategic genius. The more he gets people stirred up and upset over everything that he's doing, the more people get fatigued that much faster and the sooner they give up and give in. "Fuck it," people say. The farther Left you are, the faster you get exhausted, which is _exactly what he wants_.

My advice is: pick one cause about which you care the most, and FIGHT FOR THAT WITH EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT. Deprioritize everything else and quite possibly you should turn off the news and newspapers and TV. They're strategically using it to their advantage -- like I said, genius!

My cause is global climate change. I'm doing everything I can because, quite frankly, if we don't have an inhabitable planet, there will be -- literally -- nothing left to fight for. I will speak up on those issues not because I do not believe in the others, but because I must be able to hang in the fight for as long as possible.
