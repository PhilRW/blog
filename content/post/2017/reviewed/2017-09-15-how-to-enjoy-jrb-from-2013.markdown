![Honeymoon In Vegas curtain with projected logo](/images/img_20131010_193341-e1505488862144.jpg)

If you like [Jason Robert Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Robert_Brown)'s musicals and want to listen to the two that he made in 2013, *[Honeymoon in Vegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeymoon_in_Vegas_(musical))* and *[The Bridges of Madison County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridges_of_Madison_County_(musical))*, try not to listen to one without listening to the other. Independently one is frenetic, high energy, toe-tapping, and peppy, while the other is slow, languid, and none of the songs actually end, but taken together they even out nicely. Both have great music. Two sides of the same coin and all that.
