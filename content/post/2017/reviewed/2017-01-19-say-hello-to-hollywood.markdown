Today is the last day of the United States of America as you and I know it. Cherish these memories, and do not forget the great nation that once was. Tell your children the stories of how, for one brief shining moment in history, people of good conscience tried to make the world a better place for everyone, against a deteriorating system that punishes conscience and rewards sociopathy.

If this next POTUS is to be the end of all of us, we can at least take solace in the fact that we will all go together when we go.
