TheÂ proposed tax plan is bad on many levels, but one way in which it will directly hurt American jobs, manufacturing, the economy, and the environment is by immediately repealing the EV tax credit ([IRS Section 30D](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/plug-in-electric-vehicle-credit-irc-30-and-irc-30d)) instead of letting it expire of its own accord.

  * Car manufacturers have already planned production with this credit.

  * EVs are the only modern vehicles that can run on coal power.

  * EVs run on 100% domestically-produced fuel (electricity), compared to regular cars that run on imported fuel.

  * Buying new cars is good for the economy, and most EVs have domestic production plants compared to ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) vehicles which are manufactured overseas.

  * EVs don't produce any local pollution, thereby cleaning up the air (not that the EPA cares about this anymore).

  * EVs help reduce greenhouse gas emissions (not that our government cares about this anymore).


If you're interested in keeping incentives for one of the last great American-manufactured products, and the associated jobs that go along with making them, please tell your representatives in congress. Here's how to start:
