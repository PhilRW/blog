As Facebook comes crumbling down and the mass exodus begins, what platform will people move to that doesn't control them so algorithmically?

<!--more-->

I looked at [Diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora_(social_network))Â a while ago. It's worth another look. From a technical perspective I like that it's decentralized and owned by the users. Plus all the users legally own their own data.

It doesn't need ad revenue to survive, so that's good.

Also I could run my own server on the network if I wanted to.

Or -- hey -- there's always the original social network, ham radio.
