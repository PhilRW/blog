When taking a video on your cellphone, **hold it sideways**. _Nobody_ likes to watch videos with a vertical aspect ratio on a horizontal screen. And it looks ridiculous on the front page of the New York Times when somebody's cell phone video has gigantic black bars on either side of it, making it completely tiny and unwatchable.

Sincerely,

Film Production M.F.A.

P.S. Do this for still images, too.
