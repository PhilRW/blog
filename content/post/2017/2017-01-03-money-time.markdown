I'm good at managing my finances. I wanted to know how much time I spent on it, so over the last year I've tracked every minute working on _finances_: scanning receipts, entering transactions, reconciling accounts, budgeting, tracking tax-related things.

It turns out that during 2016 I spent **65 hours, 56 minutes, and 2 seconds** related to financial matters.

So there you have it. There's nothing special to getting good at money. You just have to spend a lot of time actually _doing it_.
