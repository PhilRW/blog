This morning, right now, at 7 am, I’m listening to some driver honk
his horn again and again and again and again. I think he’s waiting on
the street to pick up someone. Let me say this as calmly and as politely
as possible: SHUT THE F*CK UP!!! I cannot stand car horns. Especially
those that go on and on and on. They are rude, they are angry, and they
are annoying as all hell and damnation incarnate. SHUT THE G*DD*MN
M*THERF*CK UP! There. I feel a little better. But if I ever see that son
of a bitch honking, you can be d*mn sure I’m going to go over there and
tell him to be quiet.




Signed, the angry, annoyed, and saddened, Me.
