After the failure of my package to arrive yesterday, I re-routed a couple of other incoming packages scheduled for today to a nearby UPS Store for pickup.

I get an email notification at 11:05 that my _other_ packages are ready for pickup. I walk over during lunch. They're not there. The person working there says they frequently do this, and that I should come back after 3pm or so.

Meanwhile, Amazon is making me wait 36 hours until reporting the first shipment lost.

Good job, UPS. You're 0 for 2 this week. From now on I'm shipping all items to my work.
