This still sucks. I don't know how she is. I don't even know _where_ she is. I haven't seen her, I  haven't heard from her, I haven't received any form of communication from her in more than what normally should be a reasonable interval. Is she all right? Is she laying in a ditch somewhere? Was she in an accident? I don't know.

This is not how things should be. I'm not good at this kind of limbo.

Yet this is what I said I would do and I am a man of my word. I simply must trust that she is okay, even without hearing it directly.

:(
