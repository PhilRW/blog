I saw [this vehicle](http://www.engadget.com/2012/02/28/audi-comes-clean-on-a3-e-tron-pilot-program-electric-mobility-c/) on my drive to work this morning:

My phone took too long to get into the camera mode and snap a pic, so I got him just as he was turning west towards Golden (apparently the turn signals aren't functional or the driver does not know how to utilize them in such an advanced beta test vehicle). The decals say "Audi A3 e-tron" and "Audi electric mobility." The vehicle has Colorado plates, so it looks like it must be one of those [17 pilot cars](http://www.thedetroitbureau.com/2012/02/audi-bringing-a3-e-tron-battery-car-to-u-s/) nationwide.

I would love to beta test an EV. I'm just not quite so keen on [leasing](http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/120727-audi-a3-e-tron-electric-car-pilot-progam).
