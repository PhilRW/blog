Yahoo! We’re done. We screened all ten mixes of the back half of _Rogue 379_,
the pet 581 project the class adopted for our exercise. I was generally
happy with mine with the exception that the voiceover and some of the
dialogue seemed a bit too low in places. (Of course it sounded fine in
Dub A.) Maybe the dialogue became so ingrained in my mind that I thought
I heard it louder than it actually was while I was mixing it. OR maybe
the Dub A to Hitchcock Theater translation wasn’t perfect after all. At
any rate, Chris said he was really impressed with the overall quality of
everything coming out of the class and even said there were two teams
he’d hire based on what he heard tonight. Of course he didn’t say _which_
teams, which makes me wonder.... I’d like to think that mine was one of
them but I can’t be that pretentious. At any rate, I think we (the
class) impressed him. That bodes well for getting a job in post sound in
the future.
