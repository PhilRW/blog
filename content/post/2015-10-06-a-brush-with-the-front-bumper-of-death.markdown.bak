Generally speaking, you do not get to honk at me if I'm in the intersection and you barrel through a stop sign towards me. You also do not get to drive up alongside me and roll down your window and yell something at me. I like to think you are apologizing for not seeing the stop sign and almost killing me. I'd hate to damage the front of your silver Mercedes with a cyclist-shaped imprint and a vehicular assault charge.
