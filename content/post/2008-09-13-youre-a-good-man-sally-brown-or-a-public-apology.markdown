It appears I have occasionally more than one reader. And in the interest of making the internet and the real world a more livable place (at least for me) I offer the following:

If you recall my earlier post about the _Charlie Brown_ auditions, I mentioned the girl who plays Lucy is cute. I neglected to mention that the girl who plays Sally is cute too. In fact she’s more than cute. She’s smokin’ hot. She’s an irresistable, alluring,
voluptuous seductress who would make Helen of Troy look like the product of seven generations of sibling inbreeding by comparison.

Unfortunately she’s already taken. Darn. Otherwise I’d be all over her like a cheap suit on a dork at the prom.
