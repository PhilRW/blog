Final report: good crowd, full house. Deb skipped an entire verse of
“Irish Ballad,” and Nick was about to sing over someone else, but other
than that things went pretty smoothly. Strike was fast and the cast
dinner at the Crazy Crab was very tasty—hats off to SCRC and The
Haskells. It was good to see the family this weekend, but I’m looking
forward to getting home (and seeing more family on the way).
