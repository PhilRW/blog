I can't believe I haven't posted on this before. Back 12 years or so ago when I was in AP English class at BCHS we discussed the introduction of gender-neutral pronouns into the English language.



	
  * he/she = hesh ([pronunciation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IPA_for_English): hɛʃ)

	
  * him/her = himmer ([pronunciation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IPA_for_English): hɪmɚ)

	
  * his/her = hisser ([pronunciation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IPA_for_English): hɪzɚ)


There you have subject, object, and possessive pronouns all wrapped up into one tidy little word where nobody can accuse you of being non-PC or sexist. Personally I use the masculine as a default when I do not know the gender of the person, but I believe it is worth a try, as in [my post on shortening numbers](https://blog.rosenberg-watt.com/2009/05/07/proposed-verbal-efficiency-for-usage-of-english-language-numbers/), to change the pronouns for the sake of equality. Except where the number change was to give each number more efficiency by decreasing it to one syllable, this change is to promote neutrality.

So from now on instead of saying "his," "her," or -- God forbid -- "their," use "hisser" instead for the third person singular form.
