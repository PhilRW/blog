We cannot stop it. The relentless passage of time. It marches on, carrying us with it. Ceaselessly. Endlessly. Persistently. Unwaveringly. With a determination of spirit unmatched by any other force of nature. Nothing can stop it, slow it, delay it, distract it, or triumph over it.<!--more-->

This will most likely be the last blog entry of my 30th year. Time has me on a leash. The leash shortens the longer it has me. When you're young, this leash has a lot of leeway for you to run around in a carefree fashion. But this leash shortens with time. And the shortening of the leash is not linear: it is more logarithmic. Time speeds up as you experience more of it. It has a cumulative effect.

This morning a red rose appeared. I take it as a good sign. Things will change soon for the better. They must change soon for the better. Because as I enter my 31st year I have less time to spend than ever before.
