* Hairs embarrass

* Lost that linen-fresh scent

* Make love, not growl

* Last sanctuary obliterated

* Stop climbing on my face

* Morning dog breath

* You already have two of your own, why use mine?

* No matter how much you lick, skin is still cleaner than fur

* Please control your bodily fluids
