title: 'New Bathroom 3: New Shower Valve Body, Subfloor'
wordpress_id: 84848

Yesterday was a long day. After a trip to Home Depot at 0800, we got to work fixing the plumbing first. By 1900 the new subfloor was finally in.



	
  * The sillcock was just a bonus because the floor was up. I tried to unscrew it from the outside but ended up twisting apart the copper pipe instead. That's okay, we didn't need that one anyway. I cut and capped its supply pipe.

	
  * The new shower valve body was soldered into place (14 solder joints!) and checked for leaks. Repaired a leaky joint (twice) and now all is dry. Still have to pressure-test the tub spout and shower head joints before putting up the Kerdi board. The tub/shower faucet (and matching sink faucet) hardware is Kohler Mistos in polished chrome.

	
  * The shower head was a standard 72", but still too short for anyone over 5'6". I added another foot in height so the water will fall on my head and not on the lower part of my face.
