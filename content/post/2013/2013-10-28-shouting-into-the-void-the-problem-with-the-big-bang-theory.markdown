My problem with The Big Bang Theory, before I read this blog, was that the show just isn't any good. It has great potential but the writing, editing, and direction all fall short. There is an ineffable quality of excellence to really great shows. TBBT doesn't have this. That's why I don't like it.

And yet I still watch it because it may just be "the best comedy on TV." Sigh.
