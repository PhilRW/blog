This is good enough to quote as an Osophy:

> When most people say they want to be a millionaire, what they really mean is “I want to spend a million dollars,” which is literally the opposite of being a millionaire.

> <cite>Morgan Housel, Motley Fool</cite>

> Saving and investing intelligently make you wealthy, not spending.  I know—seems obvious—but that’s not how most people act.
