So the apparent end to my never-ending saga of trying to get my diploma from the administrative clutches of USC is officially “Oh, we didn’t have a permanent address on file.” Hmm, that’s funny. I never deleted my address from their system. Maybe it was a computer virus. Or a monkey ate the address because he thought it was a banana. They could’ve called... after three months. Oh, well. Red tape. The University of Superfluous Contrivances. We’ll see if the diploma gets here in a week. If it does... that was too easy. I was expecting a fight.
