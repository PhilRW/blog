Yes, I know she's reading this. At least I hope she is.  She's the only one who can. And I made it that way.


I'll bet she thinks that this would be some kind of deep blog entry. Some kind of epiphanic revelation or prophetic discovery.


It's not.

It is... I don't know what it is. A contemplation? A ponderance? A synonym that sounds like a real word but isn't?

I have begun to let go. It's made easier by the fact that we don't inhabit the same living quarters or see each other anymore or communicate as much. Lately we only write _at _each other.

Part of me longs for one last night with her. (I think you know which part.) Part of me thinks, damn the consequences, we were great together in that respect and we deserve one more passionate, uninhibited marathon night before she leaves. Would this mess me up emotionally? I don't know. I know we're split up now. I know we trust each other with our health and our discretion. I know even if we weren't compatible as lifelong companions, at least we were compatible in bed.

But wishing for one more exquisite roll in the hay is selfish. I'd have to know that she'd be okay with it, and it would probably hurt her and hamper her recovery, even though we'd both enjoy it tremendously. The better thing to do would be for me to move on, but it's not that easy. It will be a long time before my heart is ready to open up, and I can't just use strangers to satisfy my urges. Firstly, 'cause it's dangerous and secondly, because I'm not that kind of guy. Besides, there are quite practical health consequences. I've lived my whole life without contracting any STDs and I'm not about to start risking that now. It's better to just take care of my needs by myself if not with her.

And even if we were able to turn it into a casual relationship, I may feel jealousy when she started to date other people. She may feel jealousy towards me, too. Monogamous casual bed buddies? That's a strange combination. I'm not saying it's completely beyond the realm of possibility, but it's a stretch to be sure. There would have to be concrete, mutual ground rules so it didn't spiral down back into being "in a relationship," as Facebook puts it. Discretion would be key, as well as other emotional safeguards. Still, it may be easier to do because she leaves town very soon.

So it boils down to becoming comfortable with being by myself again. After such an abundance of beautiful physical intimacy with such a physically beautiful woman, that may be difficult to return to. She was the most beautiful, sensitive, passionate,  amazing lover I have ever had or could have ever imagined I would have in my life. She was exactly what I asked the Universe for and exactly what I wanted. There are the psychological aspects of protecting one's self and realizing a partner is not or no longer a girlfriend, whether by nature or by choice, but there are also the physical needs to balance. Nevertheless, I am neither promiscuous nor do I dream of adding notches to my bedpost. She shall remain, in fantastic imagery in my mind, the best part of my life for two years.

All of this is pure speculation, anyway, but open speculation. Expect nothing and you cannot be disappointed.

Maybe I should just take up martial arts again. Getting kicked in the crotch on a regular basis is sure to help.

P.S. Shit, if I wanted some kind of leverage, I quite literally _saved her life_ on her birthday. Any number of things can go wrong when you're that passed-out drunk. And I didn't take advantage of her, either. First of all, it's morally and ethically wrong, and second of all, it's illegal. I also never took pictures or videos of her without her consent (even though I really wanted to make a video of us and photograph her beautiful nude body), never took anything of hers without asking, and always did my best to respect and honor her wishes. Now she may never realize the true extent to which her life was in my hands that night, and maybe that's for the best, but that kind of debt can never be repaid or collected upon. It would be petty and small of me to even try.
