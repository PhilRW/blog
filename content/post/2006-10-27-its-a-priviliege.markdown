I just wanted to say a few words about _[Urinetown](http://www.urinetowndenver.org/)_ and its amazing cast. They are amazing. Those who know me know I rarely go into such a panegyric; I could go into detail about each of the cast members but let’s just say that I am honored to be working with such a talented, hard working, dedicated, wonderful group of people. We may be exactly one week before opening and some of us are worried about lights, costumes, props, and all those tiny details that round out our show into what would otherwise be a staged reading, but I know that we can and will pull it all together to have an amazing opening and an amazing run. So if you haven’t bought your tickets yet, do so forthwith.

Thank you and goodnight.
